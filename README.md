# Blog

When you read, do you ever clip out quotes you like and write comments alongside them? What do you do with them afterwards? I decided to just publish mine on this blog.

* [Feynman Lectures on Computation: 1. Introduction to Computers](2025/09/23/Feynman_Lectures_on_Computation_01.md)
* [Wikipedians discuss simple summaries](2025/09/25/wikipedians-discuss-simple-summaries.md)

I also scribble notes as I watch or listen to things.

* [Pivot](series/pivot.md)
* [Rachel Maddow](series/maddow.md)
* [Real Time with Bill Maher](series/real-time.md)
* [Darknet Diaries](series/darknetdiaries.md)
* [Необъяснимо, но факт](series/nnf.md)
* [TED. Donald Hoffman: Do we see reality as it is?](2025/09/22/ted_donald_hoffman_do_we_see_reality_as_it_is.md)

Most of my writing is inspired by other people's writing (or speech). Most, but not all. There's much inspiration in work and hobbies, too.

* [Guide: turn off community notifications on Reddit](2025/09/23/guide-turn-off-community-notifications-on-reddit.md)
