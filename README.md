When you read, do you ever clip out quotes you like and write comments alongside them? What do you do with them afterwards? I decided to just publish mine on this blog.

* [When to Rob a Bank](2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md)
* [Feynman Lectures on Computation](2025/12/05/Feynman_Lectures_on_Computation.md)
* [Wikipedians discuss simple summaries](2025/09/25/wikipedians-discuss-simple-summaries.md)

I also scribble notes as I watch or listen to things.

* [Last Week Tonight](2025/10/13/last-week-tonight.md)
* [Pivot](2025/10/14/pivot.md)
* [Real Time with Bill Maher](2025/10/16/real-time.md)
* [YouTube](2025/10/17/youtube.md)
* [Darknet Diaries](2025/10/22/darknet-diaries.md)
* [Planet Money](2025/10/23/planet-money.md)
* [The Rachel Maddow Show](2025/11/01/rachel-maddow.md)
* [Необъяснимо, но факт](2025/10/27/nnf.md)

Most of my writing is inspired by other people's writing (or speech). Most, but not all. There's much inspiration in work and hobbies, too.

* [Travel](2025/10/18/travel.md)
* [Getting more out of a computer](2025/12/05/getting-more-out-of-a-computer.md)

The links on this page are the roots of my inquiry. Everything I deem bloggable begins with one of those, and from there on, a rabbit hole forms that, if I'm not careful, could reach China. Follow the chain of links in the Next sections of their linked posts to see what I mean.
