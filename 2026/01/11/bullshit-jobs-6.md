# 6. Why Do We as a Society Not Object to the Growth of Pointless Employment?

This chapter of [Bullshit Jobs](../../../2025/12/13/bullshit-jobs.md) answered eight questions about the value of work.

## How to judge whether something is valuable? 

If there exists real (not manufactured) demand for it.

> When a good or service answers a demand or otherwise improves people’s lives, then it can be considered genuinely valuable, but when it merely serves to create demand, either by making people feel they are fat and ugly, or luring them into debt and then charging interest, it is not.

This is an improvement over the economic theory that wrongly assumes that if something has no value, then the market's pressures will throw it out of the economy. Purveyors of this thinking tell people to believe in dogma and forget about the facts pointing to the opposite.

> Withhold judgment and operate on the assumption that, if there’s a market for a given good or service (and in this, they would include financial services), then it’s clearly valuable to someone, and that’s all one needs to know.

## What is the difference between productive and unproductive labor in the vernacular of Karl Marx?

Whether capitalism benefits from it.

> Labor that is either productive or unproductive for capitalists. Productive labor yields some kind of surplus value that capitalists can extract in profits; other labor is at best “reproductive”—that is, like housework or education (these are always put forward as the primary examples), such tasks perform the necessary second-order work of keeping workers alive and raising new generations of workers so that in the future they can, in turn, do the “real” work of being exploited.

Perhaps, this is why it's odd to talk about productivity in reference to tasks we carry out to care for our family. Productivity is usually reserved for office tasks, that is, the labor deemed productive _to capitalism_.

## What is the proletariat?

The portion of society whose not deemed useful to the society beyond raising children, who _may_, in turn, amount to something useful. At least, this is how the term was used originally.

> Derived appropriately enough from a Latin word for “those who produce offspring,” since in Rome, the poorest citizens who did not have enough wealth to tax were useful to the government only by producing sons who could be drafted into the army.

## Is there a ranking of jobs by the value they bring?

Yes, there's a scholarly paper that proposes such a rating: the 2017 paper by Lockwood et al., published in the Journal of Political Economy, called _Taxation and the Allocation of Talent_. It confirms the author's bias against the financial sector bringing any surplus value into the economy.

> The most socially valuable workers whose contributions could be calculated are medical researchers, who add $9 of overall value to society for every $1 they are paid. The least valuable were those who worked in the financial sector, who, on average, subtract a net $1.80 in value from society for every $1 of compensation. (And, of course, workers in the financial sector are often compensated extremely well.) Here was their overall breakdown: Researchers +9. Schoolteachers: +1. Engineers: +.2. Consultants and IT professionals: 0. Lawyers: –.2. Advertisers and marketing professionals: –.3. Managers: –.8. Financial sector: –1.5.

That is, engineers bring very little surplus value (just enough to offset the damage done by the lawyers), and IT professionals bring none. Perhaps, this is why just about any software engineer (a cross of an engineer with an IT professional) has a burning desire to spend nights and weekends contributing to the open-source community to earn not extra money but the right to believe that they're making the world a better place.

## Is the word _values_ an oxymoron?

Kind of. It's impossible to assign value to our values.

> Commodities have economic “value” because they can be compared precisely with other commodities, “values” are valuable because they cannot be compared with anything. They are each considered unique, incommensurable—in a word, priceless.

But perhaps it is the most apt word for it. It's meaningless to calculate value on a value itself, so maybe that's precisely what makes the word _values_ the ideal word for what it labels.

## How does a person overcome despair?

By turning to God, but in a productive way, says Thomas Carlyle in his _Gospel of Work_.

> A man perfects himself by working . . . Consider how, even in the meanest sorts of Labour, the whole soul of man is composed into a kind of real harmony, the instant he sets himself to work! Doubt, Desire, Sorrow, Remorse, Indignation, Despair itself, all these like helldogs lie beleaguering the soul of the poor day-worker, as of every man; but he bends himself with free valour against his task, and all these are stilled, all these shrink murmuring far off into their caves. The man is now a man. The blessed glow of Labour in him, is it not purifying fire, wherein all poison is burnt up? All true Work is sacred; in all true Work, were it but true hand-labour, there is something of divineness.

In other words, to find God, a man needs to look for one in himself, and not through thought but through action. God was the ultimate creator, so if a man dedicates himself to creating, he, too, can discover what made God divine.

> God had intentionally created the world unfinished so as to allow humans the opportunity to complete His work through labor.

To discover God within oneself is the ultimate reward for hard work. No monetary compensation can ever compare to it.

> If work is noble, then the most noble work should not be compensated, since it is obscene to put a price on something of such absolute value (“the ‘wages’ of every noble Work do yet lie in Heaven or else nowhere”).

In other words, to enjoy the spoils of one's work is to take away from one's godliness. And therein lies a classic example of how a noble thought gets perverted by the rich and powerful in service to their opportunistic agenda to mold the world into what benefits only them.

> Everything that made rich and powerful people rich and powerful was, in fact, created by the efforts of the poor.

## How could the inverse relationship between pay and surplus value be argued logically? How do people rationalize giving away all the spoils to the egoists?

This conclusion could be shown to follow from five premises: talented people can lean on their talent, so they don't need the extra help; talent cannot be measured; neither can altruism; altruists certainly don't need the extra help because they don't want it—they're altruists; that leaves the egoists, who want all the help they can get, as the prime recipients of said help in the form of outsized pay packages.

> 1. If some people are more talented than others (for example, have a beautiful singing voice, are a comic genius or a math whiz), we say they are “gifted.” If someone has already received a benefit (a “gift”), then it makes no sense to give them an additional benefit (more money) for that reason. 2. If some people work harder than others, it is usually impossible to establish the degree to which this is because they have a greater capacity for work (a gift again), and the degree to which it is because they choose to work harder. In the former case, it would again make no sense to reward them further for having an innate advantage over others. 3. Even if it could be proved that some work harder than others purely out of choice, one would then have to establish whether they did so out of altruistic motives—that is, they produced more because they wished to benefit society—or out of selfish motives, because they sought a larger proportion for themselves. 4. In the former case, if they produced more because they were striving to increase social wealth, then giving them a disproportionate share of that wealth would contradict their purpose. It would only make moral sense to reward those driven by selfish motives. 5. Since human motives are generally shifting and confused, one cannot simply divide the workforce into egoists and altruists. One is left with the choice of either rewarding everyone who makes greater efforts, or not doing so. Either option means that some people’s intentions will be frustrated. Altruists will be frustrated in their attempts to benefit society, while egoists will be frustrated in their attempts to benefit themselves. If one is forced to choose one or the other, it makes better moral sense to frustrate the egoists. 6. Therefore, people should not be paid more or otherwise rewarded for greater effort or productivity at work.

So, we don't reward talent because talent is already deemed rewarding enough. We don't reward people who put the needs of others before their own needs because had we rewarded them, we'd be putting their needs before the needs of others—a contradiction. So, we reward the talentless people who always put their needs before the needs of others. We need such rationalizations because even the economic theory, flawed and misguided as it is (the whole theory rests on the assumption of the rational man), can't come up with such mental gymnastics.

> If we were simply talking about supply and demand, it would be impossible to understand why American nurses are paid so much less than corporate lawyers, despite the fact that the United States is currently experiencing an acute shortage of trained nurses and a glut of law school graduates.

And, of course, these rationalizations don't always hold in the real world. The principles are applied inconsistently across social strata—those with the power to make things right do so, but only for their community or profession.

> What is perhaps most disturbing about the situation is the fact that so many people not only acknowledge the inverse relation but also feel this is how things ought to be. That virtue, as the ancient Stoics used to argue, should be its own reward. Arguments like this have long been made about teachers. It’s commonplace to hear that grade school or middle school teachers shouldn’t be paid well, or certainly not as well as lawyers or executives, because one wouldn’t want people motivated primarily by greed to be teaching children. The argument would make a certain amount of sense if it were applied consistently—but it never is. (I have yet to hear anyone make the same argument about doctors.)

If you're a highly moral person but want greater economic security for yourself and your family, then the society will label you greedy if you let it.

> There is a sense, it would seem, that an ethos of collective sacrifice for the common good should fall disproportionately on those who are already, by their choice of work, engaged in sacrifice for the common good. Or who simply have the gratification of knowing their work is productive and useful.

If you've chosen to receive gratification from your work, then the economic system we've set up won't let too much money displace any of that gratification.

> There is a sense that those who choose to benefit society, and especially those who have the gratification of knowing they benefit society, really have no business also expecting middle-class salaries, paid vacations, and generous retirement packages. By the same token, there is also a feeling that those who have to suffer from the knowledge they are doing pointless or even harmful work just for the sake of the money ought to be rewarded with more money for exactly that reason.

If your morals are lapsing, then you won't care about being labeled greedy, and so the floodgates of money will open before you.

## How do libertarians argue that there's no problem with the privileged hoarding the most wealth?

At least, they don't disagree with the premise.

> Disproportionate share of social wealth was being distributed upward.

But they hold this principle as unquestionably good and work backwards from it to assign undue weight on the supposed discipline and ingenuity of the privileged.

> This just shows that some people are working harder, or working smarter, than others.

Obviously, the author disagrees.

> One cannot, of course, really argue that a CEO who makes a thousand times more than a bus driver is working a thousand times harder, so you slip in “smarter”—which implies “more productive” but, in fact, here just seems to be “in a way for which you’re paid much more.” All that saves this statement from absolutely meaningless circularity (they’re smart because they’re rich because they’re smart, and on and on) is that it emphasizes that (most of) the very rich do have jobs.

Since those in this stratum of the privileged have never found themselves in a situation where they had to rely on unemployment programs, they are, by definition, more adept at being employable, to the point where their sole employment amounts to living out their lavish lifestyle and calling it _business meetings_.
