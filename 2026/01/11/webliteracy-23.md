# [23. How to Think about Research](https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/chapter/how-to-think-about-research/)

This chapter of [Web Literacy](../../../2025/12/04/webliteracy.md) answered a question about a conflict between science and news media.

## How does the news media mischaracterize science?

Because news are supposed to report on new information, news reports of scientific discoveries tend to give more weight to the new claim put forth by the new study than to how it fits within the larger theory. To make the news reports more attention-grabbing, news media will sometimes make it seem like the new study contradicts much more previously established knowledge than it actually does (if at all).

> In science, multiple conflicting studies come in over long periods of time, each one a drop in the bucket of the claim it supports. Over time, the weight of the evidence ends up on one side or another. Depending on the quality of the new research, some drops are bigger than others (some much bigger), but overall it is an incremental process. As such, studies that are consistent with previous research are often more trustworthy than those that have surprising or unexpected results. This runs counter to the narrative promoted by the press: “news,” after all, favors what is new and different. The unfortunate effect of the press’s presentation of science (and in particular science around popular issues such as health) is that they would rather not give a sense of the slow accumulation of evidence for each side of an issue. Their narrative often presents a world where last month’s findings are “overturned” by this month’s findings, which are then, in turn, “overturned” back to the original finding a month from now. This whiplash presentation “Chocolate is good for you! Chocolate is bad for you!” undermines the public’s faith in science. But the whiplash is not from science: it is a product of the inappropriate presentation from the press.

The public perception of science suffers from such mischaracterizations. Instead of informing the lay person on the progress science has made in advancing a given discipline, the news media will inadvertently make them question whether science has any value at all (since it seems to be contradicting itself all the time). The bottom line is that reading the news won't inform you much on the state of a given scientific theory. Neither will reading the individual studies themselves. You need secondary sources where experts place a cluster of studies within their proper context.

> Without an expert’s background, it can be challenging to place new research in the context of old.
