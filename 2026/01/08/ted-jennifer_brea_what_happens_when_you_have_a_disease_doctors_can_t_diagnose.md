# [Jennifer Brea: What happens when you have a disease doctors can't diagnose](https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_brea_what_happens_when_you_have_a_disease_doctors_can_t_diagnose)

This [TED Talk](../../../2026/01/08/ted-talks-daily.md) answered a question about systemic misogyny.

## Do male doctors still diagnose their female patients with hysteria?

Yes, women are still being told they are hysterical by many kinds of men, sometimes even by their male doctors.

> When my doctor diagnosed me with conversion disorder, he was invoking a lineage of ideas about women's bodies that are over 2,500 years old. The Roman physician Galen thought that hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation in particularly passionate women. The Greeks thought the uterus would literally dry up and wander around the body in search of moisture, pressing on internal organs -- yes -- causing symptoms from extreme emotions to dizziness and paralysis. The cure was marriage and motherhood.

Even in the 21st century, women are gaslit into believing that all their troubles would disappear if only they could fully dedicate themselves to satisfying their husbands.
