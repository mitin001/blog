# 9. Utterances

This chapter of [Using Language](../../../2025/12/14/using-language.md) answered four questions about how people talk.

## What do people signify by saying _I mean_?

That they were going to say something else but changed their mind.

> I'd {I mean} I haven't had any {.} results. What the speaker means by "I mean" is roughly this: "Instead of what I would have meant from 'I'd' onward, I mean 'I haven't had any results.'"

It's usually to replace what they were going to say with a clearer statement, but that's not always the case. Sometimes it's to replace it with a more palatable one. We constantly monitor how the speakers react to what we're saying and modifying our speech accordingly (for efficiency or any other reason).

> When speakers need extra time to plan an utterance, that isn’t their problem alone. The time they need belongs to them and their addressees together, so they have to coordinate with their addressees on the use of that time. Or when speakers present the wrong word or phrase, that problem isn’t theirs alone either. It belongs to them both, and it takes the two of them together to fix it. Most problems in using language are joint problems, and dealing with them requires joint management.

We don't want to waste our listeners' time, not our own time, by speaking in riddles, so we clarify things on the fly.

> When Roger and Nina talk to each other, what he does in his time is also done in her time, and vice versa.

Because we're limited in the time we're allowed to take to formulate a fragment of speech, we sometimes have to produce it before it's finished, which may cause us to speak disfluently (and correct mistakes as we notice them).

> Speakers commonly resort to three strategies: stop and then continue (with an explanation, if necessary); commit to the beginning of a phrase and then repeat it; and commit to an expression and then repair it if necessary. Whenever speakers pause beyond the one-second limit, they say why they are pausing. And they use editing expressions to help addressees prepare for and identify the repairs they make. By explaining the trouble, they help addressees understand what they intend to say and mitigate any interpersonal damage they might have caused.

_I mean_ is not the only editing expression there is, but it is the only one with its specific purpose.

> Editing expressions like _no_, _or rather_, _I mean_, and _that is_ are used for characterizing the trouble a speaker is in and its relation to the repair. With _no_, speakers characterize the reparandum as “incorrect”, and with _or rather_, they compare it with the new expression to be offered.

Editing expressions like _I mean_ are windows into the mind of the speaker.

> With each, speakers disclose their current thinking about what they are about to say.

When a speaker edits her speech with the editing expression _well_, she signifies that she's about to use a strong word. _Well_ is a pause that sometimes (but not always) results in the speaker finding a weaker, more diplomatic word.

> I think he thinks it's all a little bit {uh:-well,} stupid.

Most of all, editing expressions are devices used by the speaker to save face in light of speaking disfluently.

> Pauses and errors can make speakers look incompetent, and speakers can use editing expressions to mitigate the damage.

Editing expressions may contain apologies.

> And now, Van C M burn playing Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto Number One in Blee Fat Mi nor...I beg your pardon, that should be Fee Blat Minor.

They may contain excuses.

> Stay tuned for Aeolia where they will be reading-if you wait a moment I'll be able to tell you...here it is...

They may even contain jokes.

> We hear now a song from the new Columbia album featuring Very Jail...Oops, I oughtto be in jail for that slip...of course, I mean Jerry Vale!

## What is the difference between _uh_ and _um_?

The degree of the speaker's uncertainty about what he's being asked, researchers found.

> In a study by Smith and Clark (1993), respondents were interviewed in a conversational setting and asked a series of factual questions that each had one-word answers.

They found that _um_ signifies a degree of uncertainty that's over three times what _uh_ signifies.

> When the respondents didn't have the answer on the tip of their tongue, they would delay, sometimes introducing _uh_ or _um_ into the hiatus. The average time to answer was 2.23 seconds when they didn't use a filler, 2.65 seconds when they used _uh_, and 8.83 seconds when they used _um_. The respondents used _uh_ to signal that they were having a minor problem and _um_ to signal they were having a major one.

## Why do people sometimes elongate their vowels while speaking?

To signify that they're unsure if what they're saying.

> l think he th{o:} he'd realized then. Here the speaker began saying "he thought" but suspended his delivery midword and restarted again with "he'd realized."

If you hear an elongated vowel, prepare for a repair. The speaker is changing his mind about what he's saying and will likely resume his speech with a repaired version of what he began saying.

> In choosing the elongated vowel, the speaker therefore meant something - roughly, "I am suspending the primary presentation for a brief time while I formulate a repair for this word."

When people elongate their vowels, their speech appears more fluent than if they simply paused to think about what to say next. A pause would've signified that the speaker had more trouble formulating what he wanted to say than he actually did (or was willing to admit).

> Elongations give the added illusion of fluency, as if the speakers weren't truly disrupted. Speakers may choose elongations over pauses when they think the disruption will be brief.

## If you notice that a person you're talking to wasn't paying attention to you while you were speaking, what determines whether you are going to repeat what you said? 

Whether you knew if the person was paying attention at the start of your turn or not. If you only discovered they weren't paying attention halfway through your turn, then you simply pause to get their attention and finish what you were saying once you have it.

> Speakers tend to choose mid-turn delays when they haven't yet gazed at their addressees, but turn restarts when they have.

Monitoring for whether your addressee is monitoring you is crucial in a conversation.

> Bob must present evidence about his mental states at just those moments he believes Ann is monitoring for it, and Ann, knowing this, should monitor him closely at these points.

When we fail to monitor the people with whom we're speaking, we have to make cruder assumptions about their mental states. Different assumptions lead to different decision, e.g., whether we decide to restart our turns when speaking.
