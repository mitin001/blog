# [21. Impact Factor](https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/chapter/finding-a-journals-impact-factor/)

This chapter of [Web Literacy](../../../2025/12/04/webliteracy.md) answered two questions about the quality of information on the web.

## How does one rank sources by the quality of information they generally provide? 

Generally, the heuristic for this is how widely the source is cited by other sources ranked high by the same metric. There are versions of this. Google search results are ranked by PageRank. Scholarly journals are ranked by impact factor. 

> A useful tool for quickly identifying journals that are not part of a known circle of academic discourse, or that are not peer-reviewed.

If a journal published 500 articles in the past two years and they have been cited 2000 times by other journals this year, then the journal has the impact factor of 2000/500=4. If a journal is so obscure that it doesn't yet have an impact factor, then chances are that there are better sources of the information you are looking for, in the sense that they have been vetted and your source hasn't yet been vetted. 

## How to properly chastise someone for citing and thereby promoting a disreputable source? 

"You have the whole Internet at your fingertips, and you choose _that_ as your source?"

> In a world where information is plentiful, we can be a bit demanding about what counts as evidence.
