This article was referenced by [an article on resilience to misinformation](../../../2025/11/03/edsurge-recalibrating-our-approach-to-misinformation.md). It answered a question about authoritarian takeovers of governments, particularly the conditions necessary for them to take place.

## How does Orwellian doublespeak put a citizen's mind into a state that welcomes an authoritarian leader?

Because when a person grows so cynical that he distrusts anyone, he aches to give his trust to the first charismatic dictator to come along, Hannah Arendt argued in _The Origins of Totalitarianism_.

> In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and nothing was true.

Arendt observed that authoritarians know how to manipulate a cynic's belief system. He knows how to aim their paranoid distrust at his enemies while taking advantage of their need to believe in something.

> The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.

In _Truth and Politics_, Hannah Arendt argued that the firehose of falsehood we see in the media from time to time is there for exactly the reason that would benefit an up-and-coming authoritarian: to turn our society into a bunch of cynics aching to join the very first cult of personality dangled in front of them.

> The result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lie will now be accepted as truth and truth be defamed as a lie, but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world—and the category of truth versus falsehood is among the mental means to this end—is being destroyed.
