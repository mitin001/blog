# How This Book Was Written—and Why

This chapter of [How to Win Friends and Influence People](../../../2026/01/19/how-to-win-friends.md) defined education.

## What is education? 

It is what prepares us to overcome life's challenges, said Dr. John G. Hibben.

> The ability to meet life’s situations.

By this definition, a highly educated person has an easier time adjusting to difficulties encountered in daily living. Whether this is true or not given today's education system points at the weaknesses of the system more than it does at the weaknesses of this definition. Confronted with a challenge, most people in the modern world reach for technology as their first instinct. When something breaks, we google the steps we must take to fix it, which sometimes leads us to YouTube tutorials teaching us to fix it ourselves. Over time, we get so used to solving problems (we get so well-versed in the art of problem solving) that we don't even need Google or YouTube anymore; we can fix things ourselves. In this way, the Internet embodies the true meaning of education in the modern world.
