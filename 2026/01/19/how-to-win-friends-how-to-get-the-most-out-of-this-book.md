# How to Get the Most Out of This Book

This chapter of [How to Win Friends and Influence People](../../../2026/01/19/how-to-win-friends.md) answered a question about the difference between teaching and learning.

## What is the most effective way to teach someone do something?

Have them do it themselves. Teaching is merely a facilitative process. The real challenge is learning.

> Learning is an active process. We learn by doing.

If you do it for them, you're not showing them how to do it; you're wasting the time they could've been using to practice what you just did for themselves, Bernard Shaw pointed out.

> If you teach a man anything, he will never learn.

Tell them what they need to do, but don't do it for them. If they stumble on one step, show them just that step alone, in isolation; have them repeat after you once and then have them repeat the step on their own. Don't just show them all the steps at once and expect them to be able to repeat them all after you. The difference between you and them is that you've already learned it, and they are still learning. They need the space to learn.
