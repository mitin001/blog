This episode of [Rachel Maddow](../../../2025/11/01/rachel-maddow.md) answered a question about how the legislative check on the executive no longer holds.

## What excuse does Trump give the public for flouting the authority of Congress as a check on his power?

We are to believe that Trump's actions are too important for congressional oversight. For example, when Trump sent American troops to arrest the President of Venezuela, he explained that he did so without seeking the approval of Congress because his actions required secrecy.

> He said he couldn't and didn't consult with Congress on this action because they might leak.
