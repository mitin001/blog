# 7. What Are the Political Effects of Bullshit Jobs, and Is There Anything That Can Be Done About This Situation?

This chapter of [Bullshit Jobs](../../../2025/12/13/bullshit-jobs.md) answered four questions about politics from the perspective of anthropology.

## What is the function of the Peace Corps?

Mostly to make the army look attractive to the potential recruits.

> If that truck driver’s daughter was absolutely determined to find a job that would allow her to pursue something unselfish and high-minded, but still paid the rent and guaranteed access to adequate dental care, what options does she really have? If she’s of a religious temperament there might be some possibility in her local church. But such jobs are hard to come by. Mainly, she can join the army.

US overseas military bases mostly do humanitarian community outreach, but those efforts don't seem to make a significant difference for the communities they serve. The most significant beneficiary of their efforts seems to be the army itself.

> Almost all of these bases organize outreach programs, in which soldiers venture out to repair schoolrooms or to perform free dental checkups in nearby towns and villages. The ostensible reason for the programs was to improve relations with local communities, but they rarely have much impact in that regard; still, even after the military discovered this, they kept the programs up because they had such an enormous psychological impact on the soldiers, many of whom would wax euphoric when describing them: for example, “This is why I joined the army,” “This is what military service is really all about—not just defending your country, it’s about helping people!” Soldiers allowed to perform public service duties, they found, were two or three times more likely to reenlist.

The Peace Corps improve the army's image, even despite the fact that most recruits who join the army to be in the Peace Corps don't quality for it.

> To be accepted into the Peace Corps, you need to already have a college degree. The US military is a haven for frustrated altruists.

## Why are there bullshit jobs?

Because many real jobs have been automated out of existence by the technological boom of the past century, and so the people who'd be occupying them now work pretend-jobs. The powerful feel like these people need to be occupied by pretend-jobs because otherwise they might plot a coup against them.

> Automation did, in fact, lead to mass unemployment. We have simply stopped the gap by adding dummy jobs that are effectively made up. A combination of political pressure from both right and left, a deeply held popular feeling that paid employment alone can make one a full moral person, and finally, a fear on the part of the upper classes, already noted by George Orwell in 1933, of what the laboring masses might get up to if they had too much leisure on their hands, has ensured that whatever the underlying reality, when it comes to official unemployment figures in wealthy countries, the needle should never jump too far from the range of 3 to 8 percent. But if one eliminates bullshit jobs from the picture, and the real jobs that only exist to support them, one could say that the catastrophe predicted in the 1930s really did happen. Upward of 50 percent to 60 percent of the population has, in fact, been thrown out of work.

## Why does the Right attack the academic and medical institutions?

Because these are controlled by the Left.

> Right-wing populism has taken systematic aim at the authority of those institutions in the name of a different set of religious or patriarchal “values”—for instance, challenging the authority of universities by rejecting climate science or evolution, or challenging the authority of the medical system by campaigns against contraception or abortion. Or it has dabbled in impossible fantasies about returning to the Industrial Age (Trump).

Had the Right been in control of schools and universities, the Right-wing beliefs wouldn't be so anti-fact. They're only against evidence-based approach to running these institutions because that's the approach taken by their antithesis, the Left.

## Why should there be universal basic income?

Because we live in a society where there is no scarcity, a reader notes.

> I think of visiting aliens laughing at us, humans inventing rules to prevent other humans from getting access to tokens of a human concept, money—which is by its nature not scarce.

We don't have to ration the basics anymore, so why not ensure everyone has access to the basics?

> Money is after all a rationing ticket, and in an ideal world, one would presumably wish to do as little rationing as possible.
