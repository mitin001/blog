# [17. Evaluating a Website or Publication’s Authority](https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/chapter/evaluating-a-website-or-publications-reliability/)

This chapter of [Web Literacy](../../../2025/12/04/webliteracy.md) answered a question about mission statements and stated goals of businesses.

## Why is it important to be idealistic in the standards set for an institution or organization?

Because its members will try to match this standards, but only if they're truly valued by the majority. For example, if a scholarly journal has set the standard for its publications to be high-quality in terms of its factual content and a reviewer passes a low-quality article into print, said reviewer earns a reputation of a poor judge of what counts as factual.

> If a peer-reviewed journal has a large following of experts, that provides even more eyes on the article, and more chances to spot flaws. Since one’s reputation for research is on the line in front of one’s peers, it also provides incentives to be precise in claims and careful in analysis in a way that other forms of communication might not.

However, this only works if the other members care about adherence to said standards. If an alternative set of standards emerges where reviewers are supposed to toe the line and not call each other out on the bullshit, stopping a bullshit article from going into the journal will earn one a reputation of being uncooperative, especially if moneyed interests are involved.

> Aim is defined by what the publication, author, or media source is attempting to accomplish. Aims are complex. Respected scientific journals, for example, aim for prestige within the scientific community, but must also have a business model.
