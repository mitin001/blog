# 10. Joint commitment

This chapter of [Using Language](../../../2025/12/14/using-language.md) answered nine questions about the intersection of equity theory and language.

## Why do people hesitate in accepting gifts or favors, especially those of high value?

Because accepting a gift means accepting an obligation to repay the gifter with a favor in the future. The higher the value of the gift, the higher the obligation.

> B is more likely to accept a gift she can reciprocate than one she cannot. B apparently realizes how discomforting it is to be left with an unfulfillable obligation, how it can be used to exploit or humiliate her. Even when B accepts a benefit she cannot reciprocate, she has several ways out. She too can belittle A’s act k, saying it didn’t cost A much. Or she can deny that A and B were in equity before A’s beneficial act, and that it was owed to her.

People strive for a balance of equity. 

> People compare what they put into a social situation with what they get out of it—their perceived costs and benefits. In many situations they aim for equity. When the drugstore clerk gives me shampoo, she bears a cost and I gain a benefit. To restore equity, I give her money so that I bear a balancing cost and she gains a balancing benefit.

When it comes to an exchange of goods or favors, a perception of inequity is distressing for both parties.

> When people find themselves in inequitable situations, they feel distress, and the more inequitable the situation, the more distress they feel. To eliminate this distress they are motivated to restore equity.

Should they detect an inequity, our brains respond to it immediately.

> Whenever it is enhanced or undermined, we react immediately with positive or negative emotions, and these emotions are something we try to manage.

This is perhaps because had there not been checks on selfishness of individuals, society would quickly devolve into chaos.

> The basic assumption of equity theory is that people in social situations try to maximize their outcomes—their benefits minus their costs. But if everyone were utterly selfish without restraint, the result would be social chaos and everyone would suffer. So social groups have evolved systems for apportioning costs and benefits equitably and for penalizing members who don’t adhere to these systems. There is the market system for exchanging money for goods; there is the system of justice in which wrongdoers pay for their crimes; there is a system of employment in which employers pay employees for their labor.

The less chaotic a society (the more it respects the balance of equity), the more likely it is to survive and pass on its norms. However, any system, even one aimed at placing checks on people's selfishness, has vulnerabilities, and there will always be people looking for ways to find and exploit them. Offering a favor to someone can thereby be an exploitative act.

> A might give or loan B money, give B information, or do some other favor. This generally places B under an obligation to benefit A in equal measure. B should return money or goods to A, give A equally valuable information, or the like. Consider the ways A can restore equity. He can hold B under an obligation to do something in return; this is a common technique for exploiting people—doing them a favor to make them obligated. If A recognizes that B can never make the repayment, he can do other things. He can belittle the value of act k, saying it wasn’t worth much anyway. Or he can use the occasion to humiliate B, to show his moral or social superiority over B.

The innate aversion to inequity can be turned against those who exhibit it. Therein lies an opportunity to exert emotional coercion and control. Displays of gratitude are meant to offset the potential exploiter's opportunity to turn his favor into an inappropriate request.

> When Alan offers Barbara sherry, he takes for granted that they can reach an equitable outcome, and that Barbara will coordinate in reaching it. Indeed, Barbara goes beyond accepting Alan’s offer with “yes.” She defers to his autonomy with the concession “please” (meaning “if you like”) and to his self-worth with the compliment “that’d be lovely.” These gestures appear to be partial recompense for the benefits she receives at Alan’s cost.

## What do people do when their actions impose a cost on others?

They either make them whole or make excuses, Walster et al. explain.

> Exploiters tend to use either justification techniques or compensation techniques to restore equity.

> He can compensate B for the costs of act k. He can punish himself, placing equal costs on himself. He can minimize B’s suffering, convincing himself that what he did was actually equitable. He can blame or derogate B, saying she deserved the harm she incurred. He can even deny having done k. Finally, he can apologize to B.

> Victims, it has been found, are especially motivated to right inequities. B can demand compensation—a benefit to match the cost. B can retaliate, returning the cost to A. When impotent to do either of these, B can justify the inequity other ways. Victims of an injustice, for example, sometimes convince themselves that the exploiter deserved the benefits he got, or that they deserved the harm that was done to them. B can also devalue A’s act—it wasn’t really as costly as it appeared.

## How does an apology restore equity?

> Apologies can restore equity in several different ways. They may restore actual equity by humbling A and exalting B. They may explain how much A has already suffered, and so equity has already been restored. They may be attempts to convince B that A’s act was justified. Or they may be attempts to convince B to forgive A since there is no other way to restore equity.

## When asking someone for something, what components of the request the requester must not gloss over?

The justification for the need of what's being requested, the convincing argument that the person fulfilling the request can do so easily and at otherwise low cost to themselves, and the openness to return the favor at a later time.

p.304
p.305 top

A request to borrow money can fulfill all of these if the payback will come shortly and the requester needs the money urgently.

> If Alan wants to borrow $100 from Barbara, he might proceed this way: “Say, Barbara, I need $175 to pay the mechanic for fixing my car, and I have only $75 [a justification]. Could you lend me $100? [the request proper]. I’ll pay you back in the morning [future obligation].”

By including all the necessary parts in the request, the requestor ensures that the cost to the addressee is matched equitably with what they're getting back: the goodwill of the requestor, moral superiority, a promise of future benefits, etc.

> If Alan wants Barbara to do something for him, the two of them must negotiate a joint purpose equitable to them both.

Justifications are especially important. One study has shown significantly higher success rates for those favors that included justifications. 

p.313 bottom

Another study found that giving someone your name in exchange for a favor raised the odds of said favor being granted.

p.313 top

Any justification is better than no justification.

> A pro forma justification is more effective than no justification because it displays the speaker’s intent to make the situation equitable.

## How to correctly and effectively ask for a favor?

Find the greatest obstacle preventing your addressee from granting you a favor and use it to frame your request.

> Suppose Alan wants to know the time of a lecture announced that morning in the newspaper and thinks his friend Barbara would be perfectly willing to tell him if only she had seen the announcement. He should judge this to be the greatest potential obstacle and frame the situation around it: “Did you happen to read in the newspaper this morning what time the governor’s lecture is today?” If he were to say, instead, “Do you want to tell me what time the governor’s lecture is today?” he would have framed a situation in which Barbara surely knows the time but may be unwilling to tell him, and this would go against his assumptions.

Framing the request in terms of the greatest obstacle is the most diplomatic and polite way of asking for a favor.

> First, he helps Barbara overcome the greatest obstacle. In effect, he tells her how to find the information he wants—by recalling what she had read in the morning newspaper. Second, he helps retain equity. By helping Barbara find the right information, he makes it easier for her to comply. He also gives her a face-saving way out if she doesn’t know the information. All she need do is say, “Sorry, I didn’t see the paper,” a justification Alan indicates is perfectly reasonable.

To achieve this framing effectively, one must be specific in their formulation of the pre-request.

> Alan could have asked Barbara any one of these questions: “Can you tell me when the governor’s lecture is?” “Do you know when the governor’s lecture is?” “Do you happen to know when the governor’s lecture is?” “Did you happen to see when the governor’s lecture is?” “Did you happen to read in the newspaper this morning when the governor’s lecture is?” These are ordered from general to specific. To answer yes to the last question is to entail yes to the earlier ones, but not vice versa. Which pre-request should Alan use? By the greatest obstacle principle, he should be as specific as reasonable. The most general question would not pinpoint the potential obstacle as precisely as the most specific one would: it would not help Barbara find the wanted information nor would it give her a convincing excuse if she did not have it.

Think through all the possible obstacles when deciding on what makes for the greatest one.

> There are many potential obstacles to negotiating a joint purpose.

p.306 mid

Then, formulate a pre-request that checks on the greatest one among these obstacles.

p.307 mid, bottom

By thinking in terms of the greatest obstacle, you've shown that you've already started overcoming it on your side and that your addressee is only to meet you halfway. Your thoughtful framing is earning you goodwill in the eyes of your addressee.

> B’s autonomy, or freedom of action, tends to be restricted by transfers of goods, since B is being asked to do something she wouldn’t otherwise do. Pre-requests that are polite generally give back some of this autonomy: they give B the option of not complying, or a legitimate excuse if she takes that option.

A properly framed pre-request is one's handle on the situation, something the requestor tries to sway in such a way as to gain the favor from their addressee.

> It isn’t the pre-request itself that is effective or ineffective, equitable or inequitable. It is the situation that the speaker frames with it. Pre-requests are chosen for the situations they help create.

## How to properly ask embarrassing questions?

Frame the question as if to say that what the addressee might be embarrassed about is something that affects many people, as if to imply that it's nothing to be embarrassed about.

> If Alan were trying to find out how much weight Barbara had gained, the greatest potential obstacle might be Barbara’s being too embarrassed to say. To identify this obstacle publicly could be very threatening indeed. So it might be better to hint obliquely at the obstacle, as with “People often gain a bit of weight when they turn forty—has that been a problem with you?”

## When we ask someone for something, why do we often begin those questions with _can you..._ even though we know that it is not the addressee's ability but rather their willingness to grant us said favor that's in question?

Because _can you..._ is an idiom that has evolved for this purpose.

> “Can you…?” or “Could you hand me a pencil?” and not “Are you capable of handing me a pencil?” or “Would you be able to hand me a pencil?” “Can you…?” and “Could you…?” have become the idiomatic or conventional linguistic devices for framing these situations.

Not relying this idiom is impolite or strange. It would give your addressee pause.

> You want Susan to hand you a pencil, believing she is able and willing to if asked. If you order her, “Hand me a pencil,” that implies you have authority over her. Your tactic, instead, is to identify an innocuous obstacle—an unspecified inability or unwillingness to hand you a pencil—and frame the situation to overcome it, as with “Can you hand me a pencil?” or “Could you hand me a pencil?” This way you frame an equitable situation.

## Could _do you know..._ be omitted from any question without changing the meaning of the question? 

From many questions, but not all of them. 

> It is tempting to treat “Do you know who’s president of Mexico?” or “Do you know when the concert begins?” merely as polite equivalents to “Who’s president of Mexico?” and “When does the concert begin?” It is tempting to think they have no real content—that people respond to them mindlessly. But if that is all they are, I should be able to ask for your middle name by saying “Do you know your middle name?” and I can’t.

Even from those from which it could be omitted, it would change the framing of the request away from one that attempts to signify politeness and restore equity (give the addressee the satisfaction of demonstrating their knowledge).

## Why do people often answer yes/no questions with additional information that wasn't explicitly asked? 

Because they anticipate those questions from the assumption that your question had a larger purpose than the one stated explicitly. For example, when a customer asks the store manager whether the store has a certain item, the implication is that the customer wants to buy it, so the manager helps the customer advance faster toward her goal by anticipating the next question (the price of the item) and answering it right away.

p.300 middle

Conversations take effort, so people want to reduce the effort through efficiency.

> Many managers who were asked “Do you accept American Express cards?” initiated pattern 3 and answered “No, but we accept Mastercard and Visa,” anticipating a follow-up question about other credit cards.

_Pattern 3_ refers to a conversation pattern where the adressee picks up on the insinuation of the speaker and acts on it.

> A initiates a sequence in such a way that he or she is construed as making the request too—an elective construal.
