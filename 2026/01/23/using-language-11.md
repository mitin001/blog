# 11. Conversation

This chapter of [Using Language](../../../2025/12/14/using-language.md) answered a question about what might be the trickiest part of any conversation: its conclusion.

> Here are five minor projects people often accomplish in taking leave, and in this order: 1. Summarize the content of the conversation just completed. 2. Justify ending contact at this time. 3. Express pleasure about each other. 4. Indicate continuity of their relationship by planning for future contact either specifically or vaguely (“see you tonight”). 5. Wish each other well (“bye”).
