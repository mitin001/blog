# Part One. Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

This part of [How to Win Friends and Influence People](../../../2026/01/19/how-to-win-friends.md) answered five questions about interpersonal communication.

## When is it permissible to criticize someone?

Never. Not only should you never criticize anyone, you should go out of your way to compliment them.

> Never forget that all our associates are human beings and hunger for appreciation. It is the legal tender that all souls enjoy. Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit. Hurting people not only does not change them; it is never called for.

You don't need other people's resentment, so keep your criticisms of others to yourself.

> If you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle across the decades and endure until death, just let us indulge in a little stinging criticism—no matter how certain we are that it is justified. When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

If you've come up with a sick burn you're dying to use, don't direct it at a human being.

> Your bad manners are exceeded only by your bad manners.

Publish it somewhere, but never direct it at someone who'll resent you for criticizing them. Criticisms accomplish nothing positive. You can't change other people with your criticisms. Instead of criticizing people, focus on what you _can_ change: improving yourself. Don't wait for others to improve.

> Why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others.

Every success at resisting the urge to criticize someone strengthens your character. Thomas Carlyle would agree.

> Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to understand and forgive. “A great man shows his greatness,” said Carlyle, “by the way he treats little men.” Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air shows, was returning to his home in Los Angeles from a show in San Diego. As described in the magazine Flight Operations, at three hundred feet in the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft maneuvering he managed to land the plane. It was badly damaged, but fortunately neither he nor his two passengers were hurt. Hoover’s first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplane’s fuel. Just as he suspected, the World War II propeller plane he had been flying had been loaded with jet fuel rather than gasoline. Upon returning to the airport, Hoover asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his airplane. The young man was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover approached. He had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss of three lives, as well. You can imagine Hoover’s anger. One could anticipate the tongue-lashing that this proud and precise pilot was about to unleash for that carelessness. But Hoover didn’t scold the mechanic; he didn’t even criticize him. Instead, he put his big arm around the man’s shoulder and said, “To show you I’m sure that you’ll never do this again, I want you to service my F51 tomorrow.”

When someone commits a mistake that runs a company thousands of dollars and asks you remorsefully if they'd been fired, ask them what sense would it make to fire them now that you've invested thousands of dollars into their training. Their mistake might've been expensive, but it would be even more so had you decided to start from scratch with a replacement hire. Who's to say they won't repeat the same mistake at the same point in their on-the-job training?

## How to leave a good first impression on every person you meet?

Try to get them to teach you something. Every person you meet knows something you don't, Ralph Waldo Emerson noted.

> Every man I meet is my superior in some way.

If you genuinely believe that (which is easy to do from this frame of reference), then your interest in the other person will be genuine. People only appreciate emotions when they are genuine. They will also take opportunity to show their superiority over others, and if a conversation prompts them to do so in their area of expertise, they will invariably emerge from such a conversation with a great appreciation of their listener, the person who had given them this opportunity.

## Why do people engage with conspiracy theories?

They are perpetuated by the people who are never given a chance to feel important.

> People may actually go insane in order to find, in the dreamland of insanity, the feeling of importance that has been denied them in the harsh world of reality. If some people are so hungry for those feelings of importance and attention that they actually find solace in madness to win them, imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of sanity.

If a person goes too long without an opportunity to prove their importance to someone else, they may lose their mind. Save a stranger from insanity, and he will hold you in high regard for that alone.

## What is the difference between appreciation and flattery?

The difference lies in sincerity.

> One is sincere, the other insincere. One comes from the heart out, the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish, the other selfish. One is universally admired, the other universally condemned.

People see right through disingenuous actions like flattery and become apprehensive as soon as they detect them.

> Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else.

Even as people will always reject flattery, everyone around you is constantly hungry for appreciation.

> I once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six days and nights without eating. It wasn’t difficult. I was less hungry at the end of the sixth day than I was at the end of the second. Yet I know, as do you, people who would think they had committed a crime if they let their families or employees go for six days without food. Yet they will let them go for six days, and six weeks, and sometimes sixty years without giving them the hearty appreciation that they crave almost as much as they crave food.

Give them the appreciation they so hunger for and watch the color return to them. Be remembered for the generosity with which you've treated those around you.

> People will cherish your words and repeat them over a lifetime—repeat them years after you have forgotten them.

## How to go about asking someone for something the right way?

Don't mention what you'd get out of it. Instead, justify the request in terms of what the other person will get out of it.

> Without saying a word about what I wanted. I talked all the time about what the other person wanted and how he could get it.

Every time you want to include the pronoun _I_ into your request, think about whether it could be better rephrased with the pronoun _you_ instead.

> The best way to motivate someone to do something for you is to show how it would benefit them, as well.

If you only consider your side of the request, the person you're asking will mirror you and offer counterarguments from only his side of things. A tug of war will result, in which the person you're asking for a favor will now be trying to win the argument, often for no other reason than to prove a point.

> Even if I had convinced him that he was wrong, his pride would have made it difficult for him to back down and give in.

Reframe the situation from your adversary's point of view, and you may just astonish him into complying with your request.

> The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking, so the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition.
