This episode of [Darknet Diaries](../../../2025/10/22/darknet-diaries.md) answered four questions about the history of hacking.

## What was a mute box?

An illegal device for muting the signal your phone would've otherwise sent to the phone company letting them know that you've received an international call. With this signal muted, the phone company wouldn't know to charge you for the international call. This was one of the earliest ways of scamming the phone company into providing you free international phone service.

> When a long-distance phone call connects, there’s a certain signal that gets sent from the receiver — from the receiver’s phone to the phone company indicating this call has connected; let the timer start. So, the toll begins. What this mute box does is it mutes that signal to never let the phone company know that the call started to start the timer for how long the call lasted. It would allow you to receive long-distance calls.

## What was the fake operator scam used by early carders?

The scammer would call their victim and impersonate an AT&T operator asking them if they'd accept a collect call. If they said yes, the impersonator would come up with an excuse to update their payment method and get the credit card number out of their unsuspecting victim.

> You have to sound like you’ve been sitting in this chair for ten hours and you want to go home. So, you gotta go, _this is the AT&T operator. I have a collect call from Paul. Will you accept charges, sir?_ _Uh, yeah, I’ll accept charges._ _Alright, hold on one second._ You tap on the keyboard. You say, _I’m sorry, you seem to have a restriction on your phone line. You can’t accept collect calls to this line._ Then they yell and they go, _what do you mean I can’t accept collect calls to my line? I’ve been getting collect calls to this line for twenty years._ Then you gotta go, _sir, there’s nothing I can do about it. My computer says you can’t receive a collect call on this line. Would you like to try an alternate billing method?_ In which case they’ll proceed to either give you a calling card or a major credit card.

## What's the difference between a hacker and a cracker? 

A hacker is a researcher. He diligently tries to find a clever way to get a computer to do something unusual. A cracker is a specialized hacker: one that specializes into cracking software, getting it to run for free.

> A hacker is just a person who hacks away at the computer keyboard until the program works. Now, a cracker on the other hand is almost the same thing. He just hacks away at that keyboard but until he breaks into, cracks the system security on a computer.

## Is it illegal to violate a website's terms of service?

Yes, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act makes it so.

> The CFAA effectively criminalizes violating the terms of service. Every day millions of people technically break this law by doing totally harmless things, and while most people aren’t prosecuted, the law gives prosecutors a loaded weapon to easily take someone down, and they do it all the time.

This law is enforced selectively. If you dig through someone's Internet history, it's easy to find a violation of the terms of use of some website, and prosecutors make use of this to come after their targets.

> If you violate the terms of service of an app or a website, that means you exceeded your authorized access or used the site in a way that you weren’t authorized to do. That means you just committed a federal offense. So, that lie you put on your dating profile — it’s against the terms of service to lie on there, which means you’re using the site in an unauthorized manner. Your company issued you a computer for work? It’s for business use only. If you check Facebook on it, that’s not authorized activity. Sharing your Netflix or Spotify password with a friend? That’s unauthorized use of the service.
