This Wikipedia article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on non-ionizing radiation](../../../2025/12/01/wikipedia_non-ionizing_radiation.md). It answered three questions about the negative effects of UV exposure.

## What causes wrinkles? 

The same mechanism that causes blood vessels to pop out from the skin covering one's nose and cheeks: the shrinking of the dermis beneath the epidermis. This is part of the aging process, and it is accelerated by exposure to UVA radiation.

> UVA rays are able to penetrate deeper into the skin than UVB rays, damaging the dermal layer as well as the epidermal. The dermis is the second major layer of the skin and it comprises collagen, elastin, and extrafibrillar matrix which provides structural support to the skin. However, with constant UVA exposure, the size of the dermis layer will be reduced, thereby causing the epidermis to start drooping off the body. Due to the presence of blood vessels in the dermis, UVA rays can lead to dilated or broken blood vessels which are most commonly visible on the nose and cheeks.

## Is UV exposure safe at doses lower than those that cause sunburn?

No. Even at lower doses, UV radiation leads to up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), causing functional deficiency of vitamin A in the skin and degradation of collagen.

> The up-regulation of MMP can occur even after minimal exposure to UV, hence, exposure to UV radiation which is inadequate to cause sunburn can thus facilitate the degradation of skin collagen and lead to presumably, eventual photoaging. Thus, collagen production is reduced in photoaged skin due to the process of constant degradation of collagen mediated by MMPs. In addition, the presence of damaged collagen would also down-regulate the synthesis of new collagen. The impaired spreading and attachment of fibroblasts onto degraded collagen could be one of the contributing factors to the inhibition of collagen synthesis.

## How does UV radiation suppress the body's immune system?

It's an open question in biology, but one proposed explanation is the body's modulation of the immune response to UV radiation.

> The body is attempting to suppress an autoimmune response to inflammatory products resulting from UV damage.

Just as the UV-induced kinks in the DNA molecule prompt the initiation of tumor-suppressive mechanisms, the UV-induced inflammation prompts the up-regulation of endogenous anti-inflammatory factors.
