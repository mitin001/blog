# 7. Joint projects

This chapter of [Using Language](../../../2025/12/14/using-language.md) answered two questions about how people talk.

## Why do we sometimes ask if we can ask a question before actually asking the question we came to ask? 

We do that when we determine that our respondents aren't prepared for the question we're asking.

> When Ann says “Oh there’s one thing I wanted to ask you,” she is performing a pre-question. On the surface, she is asking Betty to let her ask a question, and Betty consents with “Mhm.” But why didn’t she ask the question she really wanted to ask? Apparently, she realized Betty wasn’t prepared for it.

We do that to signal the respondent to anticipate a large, multi-part question, one that may take a while to fully explain.

> When Ann says “Oh there’s one thing I wanted to ask you,” Betty construes her as proposing not one, but two joint projects: (1) that Betty let her ask a question; and (2) that Betty give her space to provide the preliminaries to that question.

We may do that when the respondent isn't prepared to say yes, so we condition them to say yes by first responding to a simple question to which they almost invariably say yes. The first yes makes it more likely the second answer will also be a yes. Asking for consent is a polite thing to do, but underneath the politeness, there may be a hidden agenda to establish a more agreeable frame of mind in your respondent. Asking for consent will get you further not just with your question but with other actions, too.

> Just as pre-questions gain consent to ask a question, pre-announcements gain consent to make an announcement, pre-invitations to make an invitation, pre-requests to make a request, and pre-narratives to tell a story.

## Why should we always display how we construe what speakers utter in our direction?

Because it is the responsibility of the respondent to avoid a misunderstanding that could arise from an unclarified construal.

> One reason for displaying construals is to give partners the opportunity to validate or correct them.

Imperative statements are prone to being misconstrued, but we keep using them because a misconstrual is a normal, expected part of a conversation, and a conversation, in fact, benefits from resolving a misconstrual.

> When Jack says “Sit here” to Kate, he may be performing a command, request, offer, advisory, threat, exhortation, or other illocutionary act, and the form doesn’t say which.

The imperative statement "sit here" doesn't confer how it was meant to be taken until the respondent chooses how to take it.

A respondent can clarify their construal by signaling their uptake of the speaker's utterance, as Kate does to Jack in the author's example.

> It makes clear what joint project she is willing and able to commit to. She may be happy to take up “Sit here” if it is an advisory, but not if it is an order. “I think Jack intends ‘Sit here’ as an advisory,” she might reason. “But if I take it up without signaling that, he may think I am committing myself to an order, which I am not willing to do. I had better display what I am committing myself to.” Hence she says, “What a good idea!”

If a misconstrual occurs, it can be detected and corrected immediately (or the speaker can just go along with it, and the conversation can shift in a direction where the miscontrual becomes the joint construal).

> Suppose Jack utters “Sit here” intending it to be a request, but Kate replies “What a good idea!” Jack has two choices. He can consider Kate’s construal to be incorrect and correct it: “I’m not just advising you to sit here—I’m asking you to.” Or he could leave her construal unchanged and revise his own intentions—change his mind about what he is to be taken as doing. He might reason: “So what if Kate doesn’t interpret my utterance as a request. She is still going to sit down, and that is my goal.” He might then answer “Good,” laying down a shared basis for the mutual belief that his action is to be taken as an advisory. As far as Kate is concerned, that may be all he ever intended, and he knows that.
