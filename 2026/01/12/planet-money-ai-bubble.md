This episode of [Planet Money](../../../2025/10/23/planet-money.md) answered six questions about economic bubbles.

## What is an economic bubble?

It's when the pricing model established by the market stops making sense in the face of misguided investment decisions of the public.

> It's when people start buying and selling something at prices way above what it's actually worth.

When confronted with a high price of something, Robin Greenwood urges consumers to ask themselves whether it really delivers the value that could match the price.

> A bubble is something that we can point to as being irrationally valued relative to the value that it delivers.

If the stock price is high but worth it to you because you think it might make you rich, take into account the probability that the stock will become worthless before you have the chance to sell it. Would it still be worth its price for you?

> That price just keeps going up, and up, and up, until one day, it pops. The price crashing down to reality. And a lot of people lose their money or lose their jobs.

## What are the conditions for the formation of a bubble?

Mainly uncertainty brought on by a new, exciting technology, especially one that comes with inflated expectations.

> AI is new and exciting. And no one really knows how big of a deal it's going to be. There's all this uncertainty.

Robin Greenwood notes that the optimism in AI-related companies could be misplaced because people don't understand the limits of this technology.

> Precisely because it is hard to figure out what the value of NVIDIA is, many different narratives about what NVIDIA could be can survive in the market.

When enough people misunderstand a technology, it becomes easy to convince a large segment of the population in myths surrounding it. The larger such a segment is, the larger sway their misguided optimism has: on the investment decisions of the broader public, the conventional wisdom surrounding the technology, etc.

> Economists call it a bubble when the delusional narratives have taken over the market.

## How to determine whether we are in a bubble?

Look for clues: high valuations, volatility, issuance, and acceleration. The NVIDIA stock is definitely overvalued.

> On one hand, we do have some companies with high valuations. For instance, NVIDIA's price earnings ratio right now is in the 40s, which is elevated. The average for companies in the S&P 500 is more, like, in the 20s. Also, we are seeing some increased volatility in how the prices are fluctuating from day to day.

When we decide whether a company has a high valuation, we need to ask, _relative to what?_ Valuations are measured against the profits.

> That's when you see companies with really high stock prices that aren't actually making that much money right now.

If there's a mismatch between a stock valuation and the profit the company brings in, it's overvalued.

> The classic price to earnings ratio. You look at the value of the company and compare it to how much money it's making right now and say, does this make sense?

Is the optimism and confidence in the company's sky-high projections misplaced?

> A really high price to earnings ratio is a sign of optimism about the future.

Another clue we're in a bubble is that the NVIDIA stock also exhibits high volatility.

> That's when you see individual stock prices in an industry just jumping around a lot.

However, that's the last argument in favor of the claim that we're in an AI bubble. Other clues are not there. At least, not yet.

> There hasn't been that much new stock issuance. The big companies involved in AI, like Meta, and Microsoft, and Google, they aren't funding their new data centers by selling more shares to investors. They're getting their money in other ways. And also, there aren't that many private AI companies that are going public right now.

There isn't as much of a boom of new companies with AI in their names, not like what it was in the 1990s with the dot-coms springing up everywhere. Also, the investment into AI is mostly private, not public, so the stock issuance clue is not there yet. It's also not clear whether the acceleration clue is there either.

> Prices for companies like Meta and Amazon, they are going up. But recently, they have not been going up faster and faster.

An exponential growth in the stock price is the strongest predictor of a bubble forming, and it's not happening.

> The price kind of looks like it's ramping up rather than going up steadily.

So, by these metrics, we're either very early in the bubble formation phase or there's no bubble at all. However, these metrics are very crude and don't have as much predictive power as one would hope.

> If you look back at all those price spikes in the stock market over the past century, these clues could help you pick out the bubbles, like, maybe 60% of the time.

## Will the burst of the AI bubble, if it's real, bring about a great recession?

Not necessarily, AI is mostly funded privately, not publicly. So, it will likely only be a crisis for the investors.

> AI companies aren't really borrowing directly from banks that much. They're mostly borrowing from investors, like from private credit. So for the moment, at least, even if this AI boom is a bubble, it seems like less of a threat to the backbone of our financial system.

## Is every passing fad an economic bubble?

Those that have an investment component can rightly be called bubbles. That is, if you buy something not because it brings you value but because you're hoping to make money on it, (cash in on the hype, strike the iron while it's hot), then you're contributing to inflating the bubble and therefore risk being left with a hot potato with no one to pass it to when said bubble bursts.

> As long as those people value that thing a lot, then it's not misvalued. It's not a bubble. The problem is when people are buying Labubus not because they love Labubus, but because they think these Labubus are going to be worth more later on. Like, they're buying them as an investment. In that case, when the bubble pops, what do we get? A bunch of Labubus that nobody wants.

## Are economic bubbles a bad thing?

Not necessarily. As with everything else, economic bubbles could have positive externalities. Some of these could correct the negative externalities of the market.

> In real life markets are not perfect. There are flaws and imperfections. And a bubble, through the power of its delusion, can fix some of these problems. So it's like two wrongs making a right.

One of the negative externalities of the market is underinvestment in R&D. This is why AI has been largely stagnant for decades.

> As a society, we can take advantage of bubbles, because there are often situations where, as a society, we aren't spending enough money on something. Research and development is a good example. Companies typically under-invest in R&D, because research is a public good. And some of that research can end up helping their competitors.

However, as the world noticed that some of this technology was promising, a sudden surge of interest and, with it, investment went into it.

> If, somehow, there's a bubble in some high-tech industry, investors will start throwing money at those companies. And the argument is, maybe society will end up with more of the R&D that we need.

So, now there may indeed be an AI renaissance that could bring us some truly exciting technology, or at least something we could find useful at a later time. Much of the present-day infrastructure of fiber-optic cables are a vestige of the dot-com bubble, and we make use of it now to improve our Internet speeds.

> During the dot-com bubble, there was all this internet hype. So companies spent billions of dollars putting fiber-optic cables into the ground, you know, to transfer people's data. After the dot-com bubble popped, a lot of that fiber just sat there unused. It was called dark fiber. But that didn't turn out to be a total waste of money. Eventually, companies did start using that so-called dark fiber. It arguably catapulted us into the era of broadband. A lot of that fiber is now carrying all the streaming video we're watching these days.
