# Part Two. Six Ways to Make People Like You

This part of [How to Win Friends and Influence People](../../../2026/01/19/how-to-win-friends.md) answered five questions about the good things that come to those with good manners.

## How to win friends? 

Learn from man's best friend.

> Why read this book to find out how to win friends? Why not study the technique of the greatest winner of friends the world has ever known? Who is he? You may meet him tomorrow coming down the street. When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: He doesn’t want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn’t want to marry you.

Show a genuine interest in people. You don't have to go as far as a dog goes, but at least, stop talking about yourself.

> You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you. Yet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to wigwag others into becoming interested in them. Of course, it doesn’t work. People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves—morning, noon, and after dinner.

## How to find out someone's birthday? 

Just ask them. If it's weird to ask them, then just say that it's for science. Or for pseudoscience. Any excuse will do as long as you can back it up with a fascinating story.

> I made it a point to find out the birthdays of my friends. How? Although I haven’t the foggiest bit of faith in astrology, I began by asking the other party whether they believed the date of one’s birth has anything to do with character and disposition. I then asked him or her to tell me the month and day of their birth.

It takes effort to remember someone's birthday or name, but the effort is tiny compared to the benefits it confers, remarked Ralph Waldo Emerson.

> “Good manners,” said Emerson, “are made up of petty sacrifices.”

## Why should we smile at people?

Smiling will make you happier.

> Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy.

William James argues that putting on a smile signals to your brain that you are getting ready to experience happiness, and so the brain gives you said happiness.

> By regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not. Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there.

Shakespeare has made the same observation centuries ago.

> “There is nothing either good or bad,” said Shakespeare, “but thinking makes it so.”

Smiling will also make people around you happier. Dr. Stephen K. Sproul recounts how a sincere smile (that of a baby) once created a chain reaction that quickly transformed his depressing waiting room into a place where everyone felt at ease to participate in a lively discussion.

> There were six or seven clients waiting when a young woman came in with a nine-month-old baby and a kitten. As luck would have it, she sat down next to a gentleman who was more than a little distraught about the long wait for service. The next thing he knew, the baby just looked up at him with that great big smile that is so characteristic of babies. What did that gentleman do? Just what you and I would do, of course: He smiled back at the baby. Soon he struck up a conversation with the woman about her baby and about his grandchildren, and soon the entire reception room joined in, and the boredom and tension were converted into a pleasant and enjoyable experience. An insincere grin? No. That doesn’t fool anybody. We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within.

If you want to know what you can do to make the world a better place, begin by putting on a smile. It's so simple, and yet, it is so effective.

> Your smile is a messenger of your good will. Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it. To someone who has seen a dozen people frown, scowl, or turn their faces away, your smile is like the sun breaking through the clouds. Especially when that someone is you, under pressure from your bosses, customers, teachers, parents, or children, a smile can help you realize that all is not hopeless—that there is joy in the world.

A smile has outsized effectiveness compared to the ease of its implementation.

> It costs nothing, but creates much. It enriches those who receive, without impoverishing those who give. It happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever. None are so rich they can get along without it, and none so poor but are richer for its benefits.

It is especially important to smile at those who'd you last expect to smile back at you.

> Nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none left to give.

## Why are customer service reps trained to explicitly acknowledge that they understand that the customer has a specific problem and to validate their feeling of importance? 

Because the kind of customer who likes to call customer service with complaints may simply be seeking validation. They want to feel important, and what better person would give them this feeling than the one who's paid to acknowledge that the customer is always right? If a rep gives it to the caller skillfully, the customer's complaint and the indignance that came with it may disappear. They may be willing to admit user error and/or do their part to diagnose and fix the problem. The author tells a story of a customer who called into a business accusing it of exploring its customers, only to hang up the phone with an apology.

> Doubtless Mr. —— had considered himself a holy crusader, defending the public against callous exploitation. But in reality what he had wanted was a feeling of importance. He got this feeling of importance at first by kicking and complaining. But as soon as he got his feeling of importance from a representative of the company, his imagined grievances vanished into thin air.

Another manager skilled in the art of customer retention recounts how he turned someone who's initially come to his credit union to loudly complain into a customer willing to admit user error and be upsold. The manager accomplished this by letting the unruly customer run out of steam at the accusations phase, giving him the validation he so clearly sought, and treating him with utmost and genuine respect.

> I listened patiently to all he had to say. I was tempted to interrupt, but I realized that this would be bad policy. So I let him talk himself out. When he finally simmered down and got in a receptive mood, I said quietly: ‘I want to thank you for coming to Chicago to tell me about this. You have done me a great favor, for if our credit department has annoyed you, it may annoy other good customers, and that would be bad, very bad, for our company. Believe me, I am far more eager to hear this than you are to tell it.’ That was the last thing in the world he expected me to say. I think he was a trifle disappointed, because he had come all the way to Chicago to tell me a thing or two—and here I was thanking him instead of scrapping with him. I assured him we would wipe the charge off the books and forget it, because he was a very careful man with only one account to look after, while our clerks had to look after thousands. Therefore, he was less likely to be wrong than we were. I told him that if I were in his shoes, I would undoubtedly feel exactly as he did. Since he wasn’t going to buy from us anymore, I recommended some other woolen houses. In the past, we had usually lunched together when he came to Chicago, so I invited him to have lunch with me this day. He accepted reluctantly, but when we came back to the office he placed the largest order he had ever made with us. He returned home in a softened mood and, wanting to be just as fair with us as we had been with him, looked over his bills, found one that had been mislaid, and sent us a check with his apologies.

Presumably, this is why AI chatbots are so sycophantic. They want your repeat business.

## How to ask for a favor in a way that's most likely to succeed? 

Request a meeting with someone and begin by ingratiating yourself with them, but not overtly. Be genuine. Do your research. Find something that interests the person and get them talking about it. Be a good listener. It's easy to get someone talking by setting the subject of the conversation to what they're passionate about. Once they get out what they're aching to get out on their favorite subject, they'll be in a better, more accommodating mood. That's when they'll ask why you came to see them. Wait for this moment to make your request.

> “One day I found I needed a favor,” wrote Mr. Chalif. “A big Scout jamboree was about to commence in Europe, and I wanted the president of one of the largest corporations in America to pay the expenses of one of my boys for the trip. “Fortunately, just before I went to see this man, I heard that he had drawn a check for a million dollars, and that after it was canceled, he had had it framed. “So the first thing I did when I entered his office was to ask to see the check. A check for a million dollars! I had never known anybody who had ever written such a check, or that it was even possible, and I wanted to tell my boys that I had actually seen such a check. He gladly showed it to me; I admired it and asked him to tell me all about how it happened to be drawn.” You notice, don’t you, that Mr. Chalif didn’t begin by talking about the Boy Scouts, or the jamboree in Europe, or what it was he really wanted? He talked in terms of what interested the other man. Here’s the result: “Presently, the man I was interviewing said: ‘Oh, by the way, what was it you wanted to see me about?’ So I told him. “To my vast surprise,” Mr. Chalif continued, “he not only granted immediately what I asked for, but much more. I had asked him to send only one boy to Europe, but he sent five boys and myself, gave me a letter of credit for a thousand dollars, and told us to stay in Europe for seven weeks. He also gave me letters of introduction to his branch presidents, putting them at our service, and he himself met us in Paris and showed us the town. Since then, he has given jobs to some of the boys whose parents were in want, and he is still active in our group. “Yet I know if I hadn’t found out what he was interested in, and got him warmed up first, I wouldn’t have found him one-tenth as easy to approach.”

Making a request is much more likely to work in your favor if you've taken the time to first show genuine respect to the person with the power to grant it. If your time constraints are tight, you can still work in your show of respect by including magic phrases into your requests.

> If, for example, the waitress brings you mashed potatoes when you have ordered French fried, you might say: “I’m sorry to trouble you, but I prefer French fried.” She’ll probably reply, “No trouble at all,” and will be glad to change the potatoes, because you have shown respect for her. Little phrases such as “I’m sorry to trouble you,” “Would you be so kind as to ———?” “Won’t you please?” “Would you mind?” “Thank you”: Little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life—and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.

Bad manners, on the other hand, only make it more likely for your request to be turned down. And yet, we see bad manners everywhere.

> The pathetic part of it is that frequently those who have the least justification for a feeling of achievement bolster their egos by a show of tumult and conceit which is truly nauseating. As Shakespeare put it: “… man, proud man, / Drest in a little brief authority, /… Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven / As make the angels weep.”

Use this to your advantage. Stand out from the crowd by showing someone good manners. You may just be able to stun them into acceeding to your requests out of curiosity. Suddenly, someone treats them like a genuine friend and not just trying to exploit them or nag them. _Why not give this new friend what they want and see where this goes?_ — they might reason.
