Andrew Tanenbaum's books have gotten me through college. He has a rare talent for injecting humor into what would otherwise be a dry exploration of highly technical topics like algorithms and protocols. It's tricky to do that without detracting from the discussion at hand, but he manages to get away with it every time. When I saw that there was a new edition of _Modern Operating Systems_, I couldn't resist the desire to read it.
