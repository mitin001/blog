# Preface

This chapter of [Modern Operating Systems](../../../2026/01/06/modern-operating-systems.md) answered a question about writing secure software.

## How to strengthen software systems against security vulnerabilities?

Understand them and their dependencies. Do offensive research. Make the software behave in unintended ways.

> The main reason for today’s security problems is that systems have become so complex that we no longer understand them. By investigating how we can make systems behave in unintended ways, we learn more about their (real) nature.
