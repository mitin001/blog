# 4. What Is It Like to Have a Bullshit Job?

This chapter of [Bullshit Jobs](../../../2025/12/13/bullshit-jobs.md) answered eight questions about wasting the human potential on the broken system we're powerless to change and ways of circumventing it in whatever small ways we can.

## Do modern schools benefit from the class-period structure?

No, it is as outdated as teaching kids Latin. There is no factory work anymore that could benefit from the sort of discipline the class-period structure enshrines in a kid.

> The entire class-period structure is really just a way to teach students time discipline for later factory work, and might now be considered redundant on that basis.

## Why did companies spend so much time on the tiny banner ads for the early web even though there was no way anyone even noticed them?

Because they made the execs feel important, and the web was a trendy new technology. Kind of how today, every software developer is busy cramming AI into every piece of software (especially those that don't need it) on orders from management.

> Greg spent two years working as a designer of digital display advertising for a marketing agency, “creating those annoying banner ads you see on most websites.” The entire enterprise of making and selling banner ads, he was convinced, is basically a scam. The agencies that sell the ads are in possession of studies that made clear that Web surfers largely didn’t even notice and almost never clicked on them. This didn’t stop them, however, from basically cooking the books and holding junkets with their clients where they presented them with elaborate “proof” of the ads’ effectiveness. Since the ads didn’t really work, client satisfaction was everything. Designers were told to indulge their clients’ every whim, no matter how technically difficult, self-indulgent, or absurd.

Greg explains in his own words how the banner ad industry was a place where everyone was busy shoveling bullshit.

> High-paying clients generally want to reproduce their TV commercials within the banner ads and demand complex storyboards with multiple “scenes” and mandatory elements. Automotive clients would come in and demand that we use Photoshop to switch the steering wheel position or fuel tank cap on an image the size of a thumbnail. Such exacting demands were made, and had to be accommodated, as designers stewed in the knowledge that no Web surfer would possibly be able to make out such tiny details in a rapidly moving image from the corner of her eye.

## Where do people get the time to contribute to Wikipedia and the open-source community? 

Partly while they're forced to sit around in bullshit jobs, a reader explains.

> I was told that it was very important that I stay busy, but I wasn’t to play games or surf the Web. My primary function seemed to be occupying a chair and contributing to the decorum of the office.

The work is in devising ways of pretending to work.

> To inconspicuously waste time.

One reader managed to disguise his Internet browsing as something that could pass for looking busy, and he did it with Lynx.

> A text-only Web browser that basically looks like a DOS [disk operating system] window. No images, no Flash, no JavaScript—just monospaced text on an endless black background. My absentminded browsing of the internet now appeared to be the work of a skilled technician, the Web browser a terminal into which diligently typed commands signaled my endless productivity.

Wikipedia benefited.

> This allowed Robin to spend most of his time editing Wikipedia pages.

Other people get so bored during business hours (when they are forced to do bullshit jobs) that they spend their nights abd weekends doing something they see as worthwhile—writing software for free.

## How did social media get so popular? 

Because a significant proportion of our society has jobs the primary task of which is to waste time, and social media is a perfect companion to help them with this task.

> The most common complaint among those trapped in offices doing nothing all day is just how difficult it is to repurpose the time for anything worthwhile. One might imagine that leaving millions of well-educated young men and women without any real work responsibilities but with access to the internet—which is, potentially, at least, a repository of almost all human knowledge and cultural achievement—might spark some sort of Renaissance. Nothing remotely along these lines has taken place. Instead, the situation has sparked an efflorescence of social media (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter): basically, of forms of electronic media that lend themselves to being produced and consumed while pretending to do something else. I am convinced this is the primary reason for the rise of social media.

Our attention spans are getting shorter by the minute, and social media is not the culprit. It is a symptom. The culprit is the society's obsession with constantly looking busy and the reciprocal desire on the part of the individual to fill every moment of their time with some sort of (preferably mindless) activity.

> The need to be on call, to spend at least a certain amount of energy looking over one’s shoulder, maintaining a false front, never looking too obviously engrossed, the inability to fully collaborate with others—all this lends itself much more to a culture of computer games, YouTube rants, memes, and Twitter controversies than to, say, the rock ’n’ roll bands, drug poetry, and experimental theater created under the midcentury welfare state. What we are witnessing is the rise of those forms of popular culture that office workers can produce and consume during the scattered, furtive shards of time they have at their disposal in workplaces where even when there’s nothing for them to do, they still can’t admit it openly.

## How important is it to keep up appearances at work? 

Much more important than competence. Incompetence will not get you fired if you play the part and can bullshit your way through your job well. Refusing to bullshit, however, can easily get your fired.

> In professional environments, the ability to play the role is generally far more important than the ability to actually do the work. Mathematician Jeff Schmidt in his excellent Disciplined Minds (2001) carefully documents how the bourgeois obsession with prioritizing form over content has played havoc with the professions. Why is it, he asks, that Catch Me If You Can–style imposters can often successfully pretend to be airline pilots or surgeons without anyone noticing they have no qualifications for the job? The answer he suggests is that it’s almost impossible to get fired from a professional job—even pilot or surgeon—for mere incompetence, but very easy to get fired for defiance of accepted standards of external behavior, that is, for not properly playing the part. The imposters have zero competence, but play the part perfectly; hence, they are much less likely to be dismissed from their positions than, say, an accomplished pilot or surgeon who openly defies the unspoken codes of external comportment attendant on the role.

## Can you reclaim your time from a bullshit job?

Only if you do it covertly. Don't go bragging about how you have outsmarted the system. Calling out a bullshit job for what it is goes against established social norms, and if you do that, you risk retaliation.

> Once in graduate school, I had a gig doing research for a Marxist professor who among many other things specialized in the politics of workplace resistance. I figured if I could be honest with anyone, it would be him, so after he had explained to me how the timesheet worked I asked, “So how much can I lie? How many hours is it okay to just make up?” He looked at me as if I’d just said I was a starseed from another galaxy so I quickly changed the subject and assumed the answer was “a discrete amount.”

Any reader would admit to the author that he is powerless to go against this system even as he wishes to make things different.

> To destroy the economic system that does not allow him to pursue his life’s true calling.

So, if you are not allowed to express your disdain for the situation, then at least channel it into doing something productive while you're getting paid to be unproductive.

> Who exactly is forcing you to pretend to work? The company? Society? Some strange confluence of social convention and economic forces that insist no one should be given the means of life without working, even if there is not enough real work to go around? At least in the traditional workplace, there was someone against whom you could direct your rage.

If you don't reclaim your time from such a job, you risk losing your sense of being human.

> Insofar as they do have a sense of being an autonomous entity separate from the world and from others, it is largely from conceiving themselves as capable of acting on the world and others in predictable ways. Deny humans this sense of agency, and they are nothing.

Place a human into a society with rules that don't make sense to him, and he will break those rules. Police states breed the desire for uprisings, civil unrest, and revolutions. Modern workplace breed the desire for disobedience. To Bob Black, the modern workplace is a police state.

> The official line is that we all have rights and live in a democracy. Other unfortunates who aren’t free like we are have to live in police states. These victims obey orders or else, no matter how arbitrary. The authorities keep them under regular surveillance. State bureaucrats control even the smallest details of everyday life. The officials who push them around are answerable only to higher-ups, public or private. Either way, dissent or disobedience are punished. Informers report regularly to the authorities. All this is supposed to be a very bad thing. And so it is, although it is nothing but a description of the modern workplace.

When you bullshit for a living, you become a shell of a person, one reader explains.

> I used to have to go literally “insane” to get into work. Scrub away “me” and become the thing that can do this work. Afterward, I’d often need a day to recover; to remember who I am. (If I didn’t, I’d become an acerbic, nitpicky person to people in my private life, enraged over tiny things.)

Those of us who can't reclaim our time from a bullshit job can at least reclaim the feeling of doing something useful. The author reports on one of his readers who has found fulfillment in a bullshit job by rationalizing that she was at least doing her best to brighten the days of the people with whom she worked.

> About the only positive contribution she is allowed to make is to adopt an air of cheerful confidence that might inspire her subordinates to do a better job. (“Cheer up the troops,” as Pauline might put it.) Or at least not infect them with her own desperation and confusion.

Cheering up the troops is badly needed in bullshit jobs.

> Bullshit jobs regularly induce feelings of hopelessness, depression, and self-loathing. They are forms of spiritual violence directed at the essence of what it means to be a human being.

The more useless a job is, the more contrivance management goes through to drum up importance for it, and such contrivance often involves psychological abuse and sadistic exploitation of the worker, one reader notes.

> The amount of workplace aggression and stress I see in people is inversely correlated with the importance of the work they’re doing: “The client’s going fucking apeshit because they’re under pressure from their boss to get this presentation ready for the Q3 planning meeting on Monday! They’re threatening to cancel the entire fucking contract unless we get it delivered by tomorrow morning! We’re all going to need to stay late to finish it! (Don’t worry, we’ll order some shitty junk food pizzas and pissy lager in so we can work through the night . . .).” This is typical for the bullshit reports. Whereas working on meaningful stuff always has more of a collaborative atmosphere, everyone working together toward a greater goal.

And in bullshit environments, people sometimes resort to bullying to act out their guilt.

> The shared guilty knowledge that there’s nothing really at stake.

## Why do some supervisors repeatedly call out their employees for the old mistakes that have long been corrected and not recurred?

Not because they forget that this problem has been resolved. Such supervisors derive pleasure from mistreating their workers. They seize any excuse to reprimand their workers, and if the worker ceases to provide such excuses, then the supervisors will just reuse the same old excuse, argues the author in responding to his reader Annie who has found herself in the throes of such a sadistic supervisor.

> Her behavior appears to be a pure exercise of power for its own sake. The pointlessness of the exercise—both Annie and her boss knew nothing would really be achieved by telling someone to fix a problem that’s already been fixed—made it nothing more than a way for the boss to rub that fact—that this was a relation of pure arbitrary power—in Annie’s face. It was a ritual of humiliation that allows the supervisor to show who’s boss in the most literal sense, and it puts the underling in her place, justified no doubt by the sense that underlings are generically guilty at the very least of spiritual insubordination, of resenting the boss’s tyranny, in the same way that police who beat suspects they know to be innocent will tell themselves the victim is undoubtedly guilty of something else.

Sadism proliferates in hierarchical office structures. The tops abuse the middles, who, in turn, take it out on the bottoms. Unlike the make-believe sadism of BDSM, the workplace sadism is real. The bottom has no way of making it stop. There is no safe word to tell your supervisor to stop hurting you. If you want to keep providing for your family, you shut up and take it.

> Unlike members of actual BDSM subcultures, who are entirely aware of the fact that they are playing games of make-believe, purportedly “normal” people in hierarchical environments typically ended up locked in a kind of pathological variation of the same sadomasochistic dynamic: the (person on the) bottom struggles desperately for approval that can never, by definition, be forthcoming; the (person on the) top going to greater and greater lengths to assert a dominance that both know is ultimately a lie—for if the top were really the all-powerful, confident, masterly being he pretends to be, he wouldn’t need to go to such outrageous lengths to ensure the bottom’s recognition of his power. And, of course, there is also the most important difference between make-believe S&M play—and those engaged in it actually do refer to it as “play”—and its real-life, nonsexual enactments. In the play version, all the parameters are carefully worked out in advance by mutual consent, with both parties knowing the game can be called off at any moment simply by invoking an agreed-on safe-word. For example, just say the word “orange,” and your partner will immediately stop dripping hot wax on you and transform from the wicked marquis to a caring human being who wants to make sure you aren’t really hurt. (Indeed, one might argue that much of the bottom’s pleasure comes from knowing she has the power to affect this transformation at will.) This is precisely what’s lacking in real-life sadomasochistic situations. You can’t say “orange” to your boss. Supervisors never work out in advance in what ways employees can and cannot be chewed out for different sorts of infractions, and if an employee is, like Annie, being reprimanded or otherwise humiliated, she knows there is nothing she can say to make it stop; no safe-word, except, perhaps, “I quit.” To pronounce these words, however, does more than simply break off the scenario of humiliation; it breaks off the work relationship entirely—and might well lead to one’s ending up playing a very different game, one where you’re desperately scrounging around to find something to eat or how to prevent one’s heat from being shut off.

In bullshit jobs, the cycle of abuse accomplishes nothing beyond the employees showing their supervisors the lengths at which it is okay for them to go in abusing them. How badly must they want their paychecks if they're putting up with the abuse?

> You might ask what kind of economic system creates a world where the only way to feed one’s children is to spend most of one’s waking hours engaged in useless box-ticking exercises or solving problems that shouldn’t exist.

As the author relays work-related complaints of another reader, it becomes clear that such abuse begins with forcing the employee to perform pointless sacrificial rituals. They are to sacrifice their time in sitting in traffic during a pointless commute to the office when the work could've been done just as productively from home. They are to sacrifice their comfort and the freedom of attire in putting on a uniform when no one actually cares what they are wearing to work.

> Putting on the suit and coming to the office was, he felt, just an elaborate sacrificial ritual; a series of meaningless gestures he had to perform in order to prove himself worthy of a respect he did not deserve.

Readers who occupy bullshit jobs feel like they have no right to complain, and yet taking unearned money (at least compared to those who earn money from delivering value) causes them a feeling of guilt, and this feeling eats at them.

> Yes, I am the queen crystal of Generation Snowflake, melting in the heat of a pleasantly air-conditioned office, but, good Lord, the working world is crap.

This feeling only gets worse as time goes by.

> From thinking a “crap office job” was hardly the end of the world, Rachel was finally forced to the conclusion that the end of the world would, in fact, be preferable.

## Which political party is for universal basic income?

Neither. America is against universal basic income. Advocating for giving people money they didn't earn (even if there's no job for them) would go against either party's ideology.

> There are a million ways to make a human feel unworthy. The United States, so often a pioneer in such areas, has, among other things, perfected a quintessentially American mode of political discourse that consists in lecturing others about what jerks they are to think they have a right to something. Call it “rights-scolding.” Rights-scolding has many forms and manifestations. There is a right-wing version, which centers on excoriating others for thinking the world owes them a living, or owes them medical treatment when they are gravely ill, or maternity leave, or workplace safety, or equal protection under the law. But there is also a left-wing version, which consists of telling people to “check their privilege” when they feel they are entitled to pretty much anything that some poorer or more oppressed person does not have.

So, people continue to keep themselves busy occupying pretend-jobs, even those who have good reasons to skip through such humiliation rituals to get the basic necessities they need to survive. Those who can put up with pretending to work do so. And those who can't are forced to go through other humiliation rituals as they try to get whatever little they can from a system set up to keep them away from unemployment and healthcare benefits, an ex-social worker explains.

> My job was not to place, to advise, or help homeless people in any way. Instead, I had to try to collect their paperwork (proof of ID, National Insurance number, proof of income, etc.) so that the temporary homeless unit could claim back housing benefit. They had three days to provide it. If they couldn’t or wouldn’t provide the necessary paperwork, I had to ask their caseworkers to kick them out of their temporary accommodations. Obviously, homeless people with drug addictions tend to have difficulties providing two proofs of income, among many other things. But so do fifteen-year-olds whose parents have abandoned them, and veterans with PTSD, and women fleeing domestic violence.

Understandably, this person couldn't bear this job for long.

> Her role was to threaten to make formerly homeless people homeless again, “all so that one department could claim a cash transfer from another.” What was it like? “Soul destroying.”
  
Another ex-social worker paints a similar picture.

> I used to work as a therapist in a community mental health center in the Bronx in the 1990s and 2000s. I have a social work degree. My clients ended up either being mandated to “treatment” after being incarcerated for minor stuff (Clinton’s crime bill), lost their jobs and apartments after being jailed, or just needed to prove to welfare-to-work or Social Security offices that they need SSI [Supplemental Security Income] or other food/rent subsidies because they were mentally ill. Some were indeed severely mentally ill, but many others were just extremely poor people who were constantly being harassed by the police. Their living conditions would make anyone “mentally ill.” My job was to do therapy to essentially tell them it was their own fault and their responsibility to make their lives better. And if they attended the program daily, so the company could bill their Medicaid, staff would copy their medical records to send to the Social Security office so they could be reviewed for disability payments. The more paperwork in their charts, the better their chances. I had groups to run like “anger management,” “coping skills” . . . They were so insulting and irrelevant! How do you cope with lack of decent food or control your rage toward the police when they abuse you? My job was useless and harmful. So many NGOs profit from the misery created by inequality. I made a very poor living doing what I did, but it still pains me deeply that I was a poverty pimp.

The cruel system has made us into instruments with which it carries out the cruelty. It has made us into monsters.

> It’s hard to imagine anything more soul destroying than, as Meena put it, being forced to commit acts of arbitrary bureaucratic cruelty against one’s will. To become the face of the machine that one despises. To become a monster.

As more people get recruited into the instrumentation of the monstrous system that's emerged out of greed and cynicism, is it any wonder that this level of cruelty to the most vulnerable populations has become popular along the populace itself? Just think about how older people, whose lives have been largely socialized, look down upon the struggling younger people, to whom such benefits have been denied as the policy priorities shift further and further away from the common man.

> Older people who grew up with cradle-to-grave welfare state protections mocking young people for thinking they might be entitled to the same thing.
