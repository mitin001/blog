# [20. Stupid Journal Tricks](https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/chapter/stupid-journal-tricks/)

This chapter of [Web Literacy](../../../2025/12/04/webliteracy.md) answered two questions about evaluating original research and media reports.

## Should you believe scientific studies? 

In aggregate, yes. But don't take conclusions from any one study as definitive. 

> Most studies are data points–emerging evidence that lends weight to one conclusion or another but does not resolve questions definitively. What we want as a fact-checker is not data points, but the broad consensus of experts.

## What to do when you see an inaccuracy in an article?

Go on to another article. In an information-rich ecosystem of the Internet, it's not worth it to waste any of your time on a source that's already raising a red flag. Find a better source.

> It’s better to err on the side of moving onto the next article than to invest time in an article that displays warning signs regarding either expertise or accuracy.
