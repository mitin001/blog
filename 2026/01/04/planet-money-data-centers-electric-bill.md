# [What AI data centers are doing to your electric bill](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5649814)

This episode of [Planet Money](../../../2025/10/23/planet-money.md) answered a question about the rising price of electricity.

## How are our electricity bills subsidizing data centers?

The residential electricity system needs costly improvements to satisfy the surge of demand brought on by the data centers. The system wasn't built for such demand. One data center demands as much electricity as thousands and even millions of homes.

> If we do a 800-home housing development, that will be-- call it a megawatt. But the data centers are clusters of 50 megawatts to 3,000 megawatts.

Electricity distributors like AEP Ohio must invest in improvements to their infrastructure to keep up with this increased demand.

> The state gives AEP Ohio a monopoly over delivering electricity in its service area. But to keep their monopoly power in check, AEP Ohio is not allowed to set their own prices. Instead, the prices are set by the government, the state utility commission. If AEP Ohio ever wants to raise its rates, it first has to get permission from the commission.

Infrastructure improvements are a valid justification for price hikes (or, at least, they're recognized as such by the government).

> The primary reason they're allowed to raise rates is because they've invested in their infrastructure, upgrading their power lines, or building new lines and substations when they need to.

However, this isn't even the costliest part. The part that needs modernizing the most isn't infrastructure but rather the system of incentives that was set up for power plants. The electricity system is beholden to the capacity market where power plants are incentivized to be able to supply peak demand, and data centers are generating a need for incentives that are far outside residential needs (but since the residents are in the same grid as the data centers, they have to pinch in their part in creating these outsized incentives).
