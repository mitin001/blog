# [Lady Gaga: MAYHEM, Harlequin, Tour & New Music. The Zane Lowe Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzx5myHVgI0)

This video was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). Its [transcript](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=5ad4774c98b35c2a7fa8b4d1ec92f1d9) answered a question about excellence.

## How do you know whether you've given a performance your best? 

Ask yourself whether you've been authentic in your performance, whether you've given it everything you could give without hiding pieces or yourself or contriving an image of yourself that's isn't really you.

> You don't ever have to wonder if you gave it your best 'cause if it's authentically you, and you don't look back, there's kind of nothing else that you ever really had to give.

If you've given an authentic performance, and it still fails, then it wasn't meant for you. When you act authentically, you never have to wonder what you could've done differently to succeed. Trying to hide or change who you are to fit the constraints of a performance will either fail or change who you are in a direction away from where your inner self is telling you to go. Always be true to yourself, and if you're not appreciated for it, then find a different audience, one that would appreciate you for who you are. If you're interviewing for a job and you're tailoring yourself to what you think the interviewer wants to hear, then you will either not get the job or start morphing yourself into a shallow image of an ideal candidate for this job, which would inevitably leave you with a reductive avatar of a person. You're much more than that. When you interview for a job, just answer each question honestly as no one but yourself, your whole self. Don't overprepare. If you don't know the answer to a question, admit it. Offer something else instead, something that is part of you.
