# 5. Why Are Bullshit Jobs Proliferating?

This chapter of [Bullshit Jobs](../../../2025/12/13/bullshit-jobs.md) answered eight questions about our society's ills and how there are no incentives to change things.

## What has caused the bullshittization of the private section?

The industry that has pioneered bullshittization: finance. The people in this industry have decided that it was fine to distract people with unnecessarily complex org charts and financing schemes while they take all the money. They did so with a believable cover story. We indeed live in a complicated world.

> Over the past century, the world economy has grown increasingly complex. The goods being provided are more complex; the supply chains used to build them are more complex; the systems to market, sell, and distribute them are more complex; the means to finance it all is more complex; and so on. This complexity is what makes us rich. But it is an enormous pain to manage.

The economic growth has outpaced population growth. There's now more money in our economy than there are people. The direct juro-political extraction of all the resources by the financiers of our time has a rich historical precedent. In all times, there has been a subset of people who tried to game the system and take all the economic spoils for themselves. The ruling class and the aristocrats are the long-standing examples of this.

> Feudalism is essentially a redistributive system. Peasants and craftsmen produce things, to a large extent autonomously; lords siphon off a share of what they produce, usually by dint of some complex set of legal rights and traditions (“direct juro-political extraction” is the technical phrase I learned in college), and then go about portioning out shares of the loot to their own staff, flunkies, warriors, retainers—and to a lesser extent, by sponsoring feasts and festivals and by occasional gifts and favors, giving some of it back to the craftsmen and peasants once again.

Nowadays, the people who try to direct the windfall of cash into their coffers are those who sell bullshit to each other. We have so much money, and it's so complex to manage it (they have us believe), so the conclusion we ought to reach is that we should just give it all away to them and their middle managers. In other words, reduce the complexity by reducing the money pool, spend it on filling the corporate world with bullshit jobs. What do those people produce? They produce a complex legal bureaucratic system that baffles everyone into giving them all the money.

> Almost everyone assumed that the rise of such jobs had something to do with the rise of finance capital—even if there was no consensus as to how. It just seemed to make sense that, just as Wall Street profits were derived less and less from firms involved in commerce or manufacturing, and more and more from debt, speculation, and the creation of complex financial instruments, so did an ever-increasing proportion of workers come to make their living from manipulating similar abstractions. These days, it’s hard to recall the almost mystical aura with which the financial sector had surrounded itself in the years leading up to 2008. Financiers had managed to convince the public—and not just the public, but social theorists, too (I well remember this)—that with instruments such as collateralized debt obligations and high-speed trading algorithms so complex they could be understood only by astrophysicists, they had, like modern alchemists, learned ways to whisk value out of nothing by means that others dared not even try to understand. Then, of course, came the crash, and it turned out that most of the instruments were scams. Many weren’t even particularly sophisticated scams. In a way, one could argue that the whole financial sector is a scam of sorts, since it represents itself as largely about directing investments toward profitable opportunities in commerce and industry, when, in fact, it does very little of that. The overwhelming bulk of its profits comes from colluding with government to create, and then to trade and manipulate, various forms of debt.

If anyone starts questioning why these people get all the money, those questions are directed to some node in this complicated web. If the person is persistent enough and goes to enough of these nodes, they will soon find that there are cycles in this graph, essentially amounting to some variation of _we should get all the money because we should get all the money_.

> Charles Dickens, in Bleak House, was already making fun of the legal profession with the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce—in which two teams of barristers keep the battle over a huge estate alive for more than a lifetime, until they’ve devoured the whole thing, whereupon they simply declare the matter moot and move on. The moral of the story is that when a profit-seeking enterprise is in the business of distributing a very large sum of money, the most profitable thing for it to do is to be as inefficient as possible. Of course, this is basically what the entire FIRE sector does: it creates money (by making loans) and then moves it around in often extremely complicated ways, extracting another small cut with every transaction. The results often leave bank employees feeling that the entire enterprise is just as pointless as the accountancy company’s intentionally mis-training employees to milk a cash cow.

The private sector has drowned in bullshit because no one has bothered to regulate it. Policymakers are indeed incentivized away from regulating it. Moneyed interests keep their money by perverting the incentives for the rest of us. The world has become so rich and so technologically advanced, anyone could live like a king, but instead, we keep occupying ourselves shoveling bullshit around while they take everything for themselves. It's not enough for them to be rich because everyone else is rich. They want to keep everyone down so they stand out as the ones on top, same as during the feudal times.

> The whole point is to grab a pot of loot, either by stealing it from one’s enemies or extracting it from commoners by means of fees, tolls, rents, and levies, and then redistributing it. In the process, one creates an entourage of followers that is both the visible measure of one’s pomp and magnificence, and at the same time, a means of distributing political favor: for instance, by buying off potential malcontents, rewarding faithful allies (goons), or creating an elaborate hierarchy of honors and titles for lower-ranking nobles to squabble over. If all of this very much resembles the inner workings of a large corporation, I would suggest that this is no coincidence: such corporations are less and less about making, building, fixing, or maintaining things and more and more about political processes of appropriating, distributing, and allocating money and resources. This means that, once again, it’s increasingly difficult to distinguish politics and economics, as we have seen with the advent of “too-big-to-fail” banks, whose lobbyists typically write the very laws by which government supposedly regulates them, but even more, by the fact that financial profits themselves are gathered largely through direct juro-political means.

Why make your money selling people products they need when you could simply be extracting sizable portions of someone's income with various unnecessarily complicated financial implements?

> Even those firms we see as the very heart of the old industrial order—General Motors and General Electric in America, for example—now derive all, or almost all, of their profits from their own financial divisions. GM, for example, makes its money not from selling cars but rather from interest collected on auto loans.

## What creates the need for a bullshit job?

Depends on the type of the bullshit job. You may be hired to be part of the office decor or to bolster your superior's ego and/or desire to own people. You may be hired because the company would violate a social norm if it doesn't hire you or someone like you in some bullshit albeit trendy position.

> Flunky positions are created because those in powerful positions in an organization see underlings as badges of prestige; goons are hired due to a dynamic of one-upmanship (if our rivals employ a top law firm, then so, too, must we); duct-taper positions are created because sometimes organizations find it more difficult to fix a problem than to deal with its consequences; box-ticker positions exist because, within large organizations, paperwork attesting to the fact that certain actions have been taken often comes to be seen as more important than the actions themselves; taskmasters exist largely as side effects of various forms of impersonal authority.

## What is management? 

A twentieth-century invention whereby it is now standard practice to hire someone with no expertise in a given field to tell the expert in said field how to do his job. This was unheard of for most of human history.

> A medieval sword smith or soap maker could go about his work in the confidence that he would never have anyone who was not himself a sword smith or a soap maker telling him he was not going about it correctly.

Management doesn't seem to be a passing fad. We're moving in a direction of increasingly bullshitized workspaces with uncontrollably proliferating management positions.

> “Efficiency” has come to mean vesting more and more power to managers, supervisors, and other presumed “efficiency experts,” so that actual producers have almost zero autonomy.

We can afford this foolishness only because technology has advanced so much that there's ubiquity of cheaply made goods to suit every human need. Had we hit another era of scarcity, the entire management profession would've been done away with swiftly.

## Why do companies hold mindfulness seminars?

To fill your head with pseudo-philosophy, one in which the bullshit nature of your job isn't irreconcilable with your identity, a reader explains.

> They first forbid you to acknowledge you are engaging in empty ritual, then force you to attend seminars where hired gurus tell you, “In the final analysis, isn’t everything we do just empty ritual?”

Had you been given any peace of mind to engage in actual philosophy or even just some simple self-reflection, you'd be hard pressed to continue giving away your precious life to a snake that's eating its own tail.

## Are private universities more bullshit than public ones? 

Yes, just compare administrator-to-educator ratio between private and public universities.

> Public universities are ultimately answerable to the public, and hence, under constant political pressure to cut costs and not engage in wasteful expenditures. This may lead to some peculiar priorities (in most US states, the highest-paid public servant is a football or basketball coach at a state university), but it does tend to limit the degree to which a newly appointed dean can simply decide that, since he is obviously a very important person, it is only natural that he should have five or six additional administrative staff working under him—and only then begin trying to figure out what said staff are actually going to do. Administrators at private universities are answerable only to their board of trustees. Trustees are usually extremely rich. If they are not themselves creatures of the corporate world, they are at the very least used to moving in environments shaped by its mores and sensibilities—and as a result, they tend to view such a dean’s behavior as entirely normal and unobjectionable.

Look at visions and mission statements of private universities directed at the bullshitters in the industry and compare them to how the public ones describe themselves to the public.

> University administrators have effectively staged a coup. They wrested control of the university from the faculty and oriented the institution itself toward entirely different purposes. It is now commonplace for major universities to put out “strategic vision documents” that barely mention scholarship or teaching but go on at length about “the student experience,” “research excellence” (getting grants), collaboration with business or government, and so forth.

## Why have the movies gotten so bad? 

Because their scripts are passing through too many hands, many of which demand unnecessary changes for no reason other than to justify their paychecks.

> One reason for the dishwater mediocrity or even plain incoherence of so many contemporary movie scripts is that each of these supernumeraries will typically insist on changing at least a line or two, just to be able to say they had some influence on the final product. I first heard about this when after seeing the endlessly terrible 2008 remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still. The entire plot seemed to be designed to lead up to a moment of realization, where the alien comes to understand the true nature of humanity (that they are not basically evil, just very bad at handling grief). Yet when the moment came, the alien never actually said this. I asked a friend in the industry how this could have happened and he assured me that the line I was expecting was almost certainly in the original script; some useless executives must have intervened to change it. “You see there are usually dozens of these guys hovering around any production and every one of them will feel they have to jump in and change around at least one line—or else what’s the excuse for their even being there?”

The bullshitization of the movie-making industry has ruined movies, just as bullshit ruins any good or service it touches. It's like when moneyed interests ruined the laws and science so the interests of the populace are no longer served and new exciting scientific discoveries are no longer being made.

> One of the main reasons for technological stagnation over the last several decades is that scientists, too, have to spend so much of their time vying with one another to convince potential donors they already know what they are going to discover.

## What is the right-wing playbook for framing the narrative about how good a job they're doing with respect to the economy? 

Assert that the market is an all-powerful force that can only deliver good results and that any government oversight detracts from it. Then, attribute all currently observable positive outcomes to the market and blame all negative outcomes on regulation.

> Since all actually existing market systems are to some degree state regulated, it’s easy enough to insist that any results one likes (say, high levels of overall wealth) are the result of the workings of the market, and that any features one doesn’t like (say, high levels of overall poverty) are really due to government interference in the workings of the market—and then insist that the burden of proof is on anyone who would argue otherwise. No real evidence in favor of the position is required because it is basically a profession of faith.

It's easy to shout down any factual arguments when one's mind is dead-set on a dogma, and the best part is that one never has to reach for any facts in the first place. The dogma already spells it all out, and one better fall in line or else be trampled on by an army of its adherents. This is also why right-wingers support the creation of bullshit jobs: their ideology allows for them.

> When right-wing politicians call for tax cuts to put more money in the hands of “job creators,” they never specify whether those jobs will be good for anything; it’s simply assumed that if the market produced them, they will be.

Even though you must fall in line, you can still make the best of the system constrained by the dogmatic rules imposed by the interests of the Party.

> Once a situation is created, even as an unintended side effect, politicians can be expected to size up the larger political implications of that situation when they make up their minds what—if anything—to do about it. Does this mean that members of the political class might actually collude in the maintenance of useless employment?

## Do authoritarian governments make up bullshit jobs for the same reason as we do? 

No, authoritarian governments must pretend they have it all under control, and asserting that there's no such thing as unemployment is part of it (even when it means that people are employed unnecessarily).

> The regime of make-work jobs that existed in the Soviet Union or Communist China, for example, was created from above by a self-conscious government policy of full employment. To say this is in no sense controversial. Pretty much everyone accepts that it is the case. Still, it’s hardly as if anyone sitting in the Kremlin or the Great Hall of the People actually sent out a directive saying “I hereby order all officials to invent unnecessary jobs until unemployment is eliminated.” The reason no such orders were sent out was because they didn’t have to be. The policy spoke for itself.

Meanwhile, the so-called free world is beholden to the moneyed interests for whom there's no reason to change the system where the desire to keep people occupied shoveling bullshit around (something to which the human societies seem to resolve naturally, evidenced by self-imposed hierarchies, feudalistic desires, etc). No one cares about solving the society's ills as long as there's money to be made from them.

> I had a friend who was addicted to heroin and went on a methadone program. Bored of waiting for doctors to decide he was “ready” to begin reducing his dosage, he started pouring off a little of the drug each day until, some months later, he was able to announce triumphantly that he was clean. His doctor was furious, and told him only professionals have the competence to decide when he should have done this. It turns out the program was funded on the basis of the number of patients they served and had no incentive to actually get anyone off drugs. One should never underestimate the power of institutions to try to preserve themselves. One explanation for the thirty-year impasse of the Israeli-Palestinian “peace process”—if at this point one can even call it that—is that on both sides, there are now powerful institutional structures which would lose their entire raison d’être if the conflict ended, but also, a vast “peace apparatus” of NGOs and UN bureaucrats whose careers have become entirely dependent on maintaining the fiction that a “peace process” is, in fact, going on.
