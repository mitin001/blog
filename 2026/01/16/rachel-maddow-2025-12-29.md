# [Live community event: Rachel Maddow Presents: Burn Order](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/509873?episode=47585566876): [12/29/2025](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=8d248c45c184d7572b42bc5092fdfb21)

This live event shared by [Rachel Maddow](../../../2025/11/01/rachel-maddow.md) answered three questions about the effects of abuses of power: how the perpetrators cover up the abuse and what happens to the victims.

## What to do when you hear excuses that victims of abuses of power were asking for what happened to them?

Don't buy into the smear campaign the powerful are waging to try to excuse their abuses of said power.

> There are no perfect victims, and your perfection should not define whether or not we see you as a victim.

When Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent, many people on social media bought into the narrative that she was asking for what he did to her. Many comments under the video of her execution said "FAFO." When the Trump administration defied a court order and deported Kilmar Ábriego Garcia to Ecuador, the government tried to silence the outcry by digging up dirt on him. They found that he has been accused of domestic violence. Every time there's an abuse of power, the powerful will try to turn the public opinion against the victim. Do not buy into their efforts to blame the victim. See the smear campaigns for what they are.

## Why are Japanese Americans such perfectionists?

Because these are typically the children of people who, despite having done nothing wrong, have been incarcerated by the American government. There was a period in American history in which Japanese people were taken from their home and sent to camps for no reason other than to let the government exercise abuses of power against a minority population. The Japanese perfectionism is a coping mechanism. It's a way to hold onto the hope that you are still in control of your destiny. The next time the men in uniforms come for you, maybe they would see how perfect you are and spare you.

> My parents lived in great fear after their release because they were afraid that anything that we might do could put us back in prison again. So much unpredictability 'cause they never committed a crime that justified what happened to them. So the transmission of trauma is really evident in the need to succeed and the threat and danger if you don't. So my parents communicated to me on a regular basis, if you get a B, if you get in trouble, the teacher scolds you. If you get a parking ticket, that drastic, horrible things are gonna happen in your life. And so the need to achieve, many of the young people that I treated in my practice were young people who were so stressed from the amount of pressure they felt from their parents because it was a dangerous world for my parents. And our need to success was how we were gonna save our parents from that kind of anxiety.

## Why is the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans referred to _relocation_ in history books?

The efforts to distance the American government from its abuses of power run deep. It beings with whitewashing the language.

> The euphemistic language used to minimize the trauma, the ways in which they protected themselves by using words like _relocation_.

The proper term is _incarceration_, not _relocation_. The great many people who have lived this have the capacity to tell you what has been done to them.

> The ability of the people to name their own experiences.

We owe it to them to at least get the words right.

> One of the signs of growing up is becoming intolerant of euphemism.
