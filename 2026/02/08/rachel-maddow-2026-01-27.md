This episode of [Rachel Maddow](../../../2025/11/01/rachel-maddow.md) answered a question about the immigrants-as-scapegoats phase of the American descent into authoritarianism.

## Has the American society become so coarse that cruelty to immigrants now passes as an acceptable policy priority?

Not yet. Trump's military takeover of Minneapolis by ICE was widely unpopular. So much so that even corporations (which are normally risk-averse and therefore apolotical) have started speaking out against it.

> Even in the the sinkhole of sniveling cowardice that has been America's business so-called leaders, even there they're starting to ever so tentatively squeak that maybe, possibly, if nobody minds, they might want to express that they're mildly uncomfortable with what Trump and the Trump administration are doing. Chief executives of Target, Best Buy, General Mills, Cargill, Land O'Lakes, Hormel, US Bancorp, the Mayo Clinic, 3M and dozens of other large Minnesota employers issued a public letter Sunday calling for "an immediate de-escalation" in their state. And yes, that is too little, and yes, that is too late, but it is way more than they were willing to do before. So take it, bank it and build on it.

Corporations don't typically make political statements for the risk of alienating parts of the public that would disagree with their politics. The fact that corporations are starting to make political pronouncements when it comes to cruelty to immigrants signifies that Trump's policies are becoming universally unpopular.
