This episode of [Real Time](../../../2025/10/16/real-time.md) answered a question about celebrity endorsements of causes.

## Why does Bill Maher refuse to wear pins and ribbons for causes like the rest of the celebrities at showbusiness celebration events?

Because he sees virtue signaling gestures of celebrities as useless at best and irritating at worst.

> I know the celebrities mean well, and we thank them for having their heart in the right place, but just do you. Do what you do so well. Use your extraordinary talents for the noble cause of bringing relief from the problems that ribbons and pins can't fix.

Doing your job is enough. You do not need to undergo a phony ritual to show how good of a person you are. You can accomplish this much better by simply being one: treating people with kindness and showing them respect. What good is spreading awareness when awareness doesn't equal action?
