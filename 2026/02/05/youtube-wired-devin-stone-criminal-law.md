This video was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). Its [transcript](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=ea27049ac337324a368de8d8ffdbaafc) answered a question about jury trials.

## Do all criminal trials require a jury?

No, the defendant has the option of having the judge reach the verdict solo, waiving the right to be judged by a jury of their peers. One is not necessarily better than the other. One cannot predict which deliberator is expected to look upon the defendant more favorably from the circumstances of the case.

> If you are being charged with a crime, you almost always have the option to be tried by a judge instead of a jury. Some people believe that if you have a really complicated technical case, a patent case involving technology, or maybe a securities-related case, you'd want a judge because the common thinking is that the judge is going to be able to understand more complex topics. That's not always the case. Sometimes people believe that if you have a really emotional case, you'll want the jury because they are more easily swayable. That's also not always the case.
