# 12. Layering

This chapter of [Using Language](../../../2025/12/14/using-language.md) answered five questions about what one can do with language, especially when it comes to going out of one's way to treat people with politeness.

## When we pick the next movie or book to enjoy, how do we choose its genre?

We ask ourselves which emotion we want to experience.

> Novels, from pulp to the classics, are classified into genres largely by emotions they get us to experience. Mysteries evoke suspense, fear. Adventure stories evoke excitement, fear, anger. Horror stories evoke horror, loathing, fear. Romances lead to light sexual excitement, and pornography, to base erotic arousal. Satires evoke amusement.

I don't like to experience horror, but sometimes I watch horror movies if they teach me something I can't learn any other way (e.g., how to overcome the fear of horror movies). In that case, I ask myself not which emotion I want to experience next but rather whether I am prepared to tolerate the unpleasant emotion of horror that will otherwise be good for me.

## When is declining an invitation the polite thing to do? 

When an invitation was ostensible.

> Ross and Cathy have a date to study one evening, but Ross has a problem. Some old friends of his from Southern California have called to say they are arriving at Stanford that evening and want him to go to a basketball game at Berkeley, about an hour away, and he has accepted.

Ross invited Cathy to come along with him, but only to be polite. He did not actually want her to go. The invitation was an exercise in joint pretense to repair the possible damage to the relationship over the cancellation of their date.

> He didn't honestly want her to accept, and recognizing this, she didn't. With this maneuver they were both satisfied. On the surface, he had given her the chance to go along and she had declined. At the same time, but below the surface, he showed her that he still cared for her, and she showed him that she understood that. The date dissolved without public rancor or loss of face.

An invitation is ostensible when it is extended only to give you an opportunity to save face. Ostensible invitations are to be declined.

> He is putting on public display an act that shows how highly he regards her. Yet he intends her to see that he doesn’t really want her to go along, and to be polite she should decline. So Ross gets Cathy to appreciate that he doesn’t want her to go, yet avoids putting that on record, which would lead to loss of face. What he puts on record instead is a display of his regard for her.

Ostensible invitations show a hint of hesitation. People extending ostensible invitations do so with ambivalence.

> If asked, A couldn't sincerely say he wanted B to go to event E, nor could he sincerely say he didn't. (Ross couldn't honestly say "Yes, I really want you to come," because he didn't really want Cathy to go. Yet he also couldn't admit to her publicly that he didn't want her to come, for that would imply hedidn't regard her highly enough to invite her.)

Ostensible invitations convey contrast, not a sincere request, but for a good reason.

> A intends A and B to mutually recognize certain contrasts between the demonstrated and actual situations and to see A's reason for highlighting them. (Ross wants Cathy to compare what could be, that he really wants her to go, with what is, that he doesn't actually want her to go. She will then see that he would like to have been with her if circumstances had been different—that he still enjoyed and wanted her company.)

Ostensible speech is not the same thing as sarcasm. People own up to sarcasm but not to ostensible speech.

> If Ross had been sarcastic in asking, “Do you want to come,” he would deny he really wanted Cathy to go, and she might respond with equal sarcasm, “Yeah, I just love hanging out with the guys.” What makes the invitation ostensible is that he wouldn’t deny either that he really wanted Cathy to go, or that he didn’t. He displays ambivalence. And he wants her to respond by colluding with him, by pretending to take the invitation seriously and declining, which she does. Ostensible invitations project ostensible responses.

When someone makes an ostensible utterance at you, respond in kind: ostensibly. Collude with the speaker, but do not take what they're saying at face value. Vague invitations are not invitations.

> “Let’s have lunch sometime.” A hedges the invitation with such expressions as “well,” “I guess,” “maybe,” and “if you want.” A delivers the invitation with inappropriate cues. Flatter intonation, hesitations, rapid speaking. Any sign to show that he or she isn’t fully committed to the invitation.

Ostensible invitations like this are to project that your addressee enjoys your company so much they wouldn't mind having lunch with you, but these are not at all real invitations to lunch.

> Ostensible invitations are risky, which is one of their virtues.

People employ ostensible invitations to strengthen their relationships. They are like a trust fall: the person issuing the invitation trusts that the other will not misconstrue it as sincere and will play along.

> In creating these idealized acts, the participants jointly avoid putting on record troublesome issues that might otherwise come up. Ross and Cathy avoid discussing why he would rather go out with the guys than with her.

Every once in a while ever relationship hits a bump, and with ostensible speech the speaker trusts that his addressee will not make a scene out of it.

> The point of the speaker’s pretense is to show appreciation for the addressee and to keep the half-heartedness of the invitation off record.

Ostensibility optimizes relationships by offering a quick way out of a troublesome situation.

> When the loser of a game congratulates the winner, the congratulations and its acceptance are usually recognized as ostensible. The loser isn’t honestly happy that the winner won, and the winner recognizes this. Or when a child is required by a mother or school teacher to apologize to another child for some wrong, that apology and its acceptance are ordinarily ostensible as well. The first child, apologizing under protest, isn’t really sorry, and the second child recognizes this. These congratulations and apologies are heard not as insincere but as ostensible. The loser and the child, by asking their partners to imagine the real congratulations and apology, display a sincere regard for the recipients or the system they belong to.

Ostensibility is a variation of _fake it till you make it_. We pretend to be happy, and so it makes us happy. The prophecy self-fulfills.

> When the participants create idealized ostensible acts, like Ross and Cathy’s invitation and declination, they deal with self-worth. They display a mutually respectful exchange in a situation that otherwise threatens to reveal the opposite. And when they keep troublesome issues off record, they also deal with autonomy. They avoid discussing the issues explicitly.

## Why is it impolite to answer _How are you?_ with something other than some variation of _I'm fine_?

Because this is an ostensible question. The person you just met is showing you respect, not sincerely asking to tell them about your health. _How are you?_ is an idiom. If you are healthy enough to talk, then the only polite response is to simply admit good health and move on with a conversation.

> When Morris says, “How are you,” he is ostensibly asking Miss Detch how she is, and with “Fine” she is ostensibly answering that question. Morris would be surprised and disappointed if Detch really did say how she was, and she recognizes this. Morris and Detch make clear the ostensibility of their actions in several ways. When Detch says “thank you,” it isn’t for Morris’ question. Rather, it is for Morris showing he cares enough to display a concern about her health. And Morris considers his display to be all that is needed. He doesn’t even wait for Detch’s answer before starting the next utterance. So with the exchange “How are you?” “Fine thank you,” Morris and Detch imagine an exchange in which a concerned Morris asks Detch about her health, and she tells him sincerely that it is fine. They appreciate that Morris’ purpose is to display a personal concern as a preliminary to their talk, and hers is to display a healthy person ready to enter that talk.

This is not to say that ostensibility is the opposite of sincerity. Insinserity is. Ostensibility lies in between. It is neutral and non-committal.

## Why is it more polite to ask whether your addressee knows where something is rather than asking for directions explicitly even when your goal from the interaction is to find directions?

Because it is impolite to be putting someone in a position of having to say _I don't know_, especially when the language you're speaking has an idiom for avoiding that.

> Do you know where Goldberg's Grocery is?

On the other hand, asking for directions explicitly skips a step in the traditional protocol for such interactions—the step that exists to let the addressee save face if needed.

> If Verona didn’t know where Goldberg’s Grocery was, it would be embarrassing to ask her. To avoid that embarrassment, I pretended to ask her only whether she knew, and she colluded with me by saying “Yes.” Yet she appreciated why I initiated the ostensible question, recognizing that I wanted to find Goldberg’s Grocery. So she took up that proposed joint project as well and said, “It’s just around the corner.” She pretended with me that I was asking her a question, and she colluded with me in answering it.

## If someone asks you if you know the time, why is it more polite to include a _yes_ in your response rather than simply giving them the time, even though that's the actual goal of the question?

Because someone introduces ostensibility into an interaction, they must have a reason to do so, and so it is more polite to play along. The person is giving you a face-saving out in case you can't answer their question, so do your part to show your appreciation for this.

> “Could you tell me what time you close?” is judged as more polite than “What time do you close?” The manager also realizes that Susan has offered him the option of being polite in return. All he has to do is answer her ostensible question first with “yes,” and that is face-saving for her to do too. Indeed, for pro forma pre-requests like “Could you tell me,” the response “Yes, we close at six” is judged to be more polite than “We close at six.”
