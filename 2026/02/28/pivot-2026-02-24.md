This episode of [Pivot](../../../2025/10/14/pivot.md) answered a question about Trump's economic policy.

## Why do corporations affected by Trump tariffs have the right to demand reimbursement from the government? 

Because the tariffs that they were forced to pay were found to be unconstitutional.

> You took the money from them. Give it back.

Not only does the government still have their money but it also has the payment information they can use to issue refunds.

> If they collected this money easily, I don't see why they can't reimburse it easily.
