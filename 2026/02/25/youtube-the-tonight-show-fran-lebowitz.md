# [Fran Lebowitz on The Tonight Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnNkU28z9xg)

This video was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). Its [transcript](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=871f24ae9578bf6cb0e6cc45f7f85341) answered two questions about doctors and lawyers.

## When should one call a lawyer?

As a last resort, says Fran Lebowitz.

> Here's the upside of being old. Not that it's worth it, but the upside is this: you learn that no matter how bad a problem you have, if you want to make it worse, call a lawyer.

## Does plastic surgery make old people look young? 

No, it makes people look surgical.

> There's not a lot of choices in life like you think there are, okay? There's three ways to look: young, old, or surgical.
