# [How Do People NOT Know This About Pop Music?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l93JOUJZEoA)

This video was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). Its [transcript](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=086391000fdf181fd020f97e514acda5) answered two questions about the music industry.

## Why is Jack Antonoff credited on so many hit pop songs? 

Because he's the one writing them, he has the talent for this sort of production. Pop music today is modular. Talent is separated from marketing. The talented songwriters like Jack Antonoff and Amy Allen are responsible for the creative portion of it, and young, attractive people are used to market it.

> These songwriters need artists that are young, let's be honest about it, that are the vehicles for their songs.

Talent is relegated to the behind-the-scenes production while the spotlight is given to those who seek it. 

## Why do people agree to share credit for the work they did entirely on their own with freeloaders?

Because said freeloaders give the song their platform, without which no one would see the work.

> In order to get your song cut by a huge star, you have to give them a piece of the song, even if they wrote nothing.

A song written by Jack Antonoff won't be a hit unless he adds Taylor Swift or Sabrina Carpenter on it as a songwriter.
