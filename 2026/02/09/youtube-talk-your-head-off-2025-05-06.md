This video was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). It answered a question about the etiquette of dating.

## Why must a man always pay for a woman's meal when they are on a date?

Because the woman has already probably invested far more into the date than the price of her meal, Kathy Griffin explains.

> I purchased a bunch of makeup, I put it on. I purchased hair products that you didn't have to do. I purchased special clothing, and most women just sort of have more clothes than most guys do. I'm probably in shoes that are so uncomfortable, you could never walk in them. Look at these shoes. I know they're amazing, but try walking in them. I actually feel that's one of the reasons that going Dutch is just lame and just makes you look really cheap. But I don't have anything against a guy that's poor, and so if you're poor, make me some spaghetti. I'll be happy. At least you put in the effort.

The least a man can do to restore the balance of equity is pinch in and pay for the meal, whatever he can afford.
