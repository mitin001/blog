This episode of [Rachel Maddow](../../../2025/11/01/rachel-maddow.md) answered a question about modern-day tyranny.

## Is Trump a tyrant?

If we assess tyranny by the degree of sacrifice martyrs are called upon to accept, then yes, Trump is a tyrant. It has come to this: at least one Episcopal bishop, Rob Hirschfeld, is calling for his clergy to prepare to sacrifice their lives in fighting Trump.

> Live your life without fear of death. Be prepared. I'm not asking you to go look for that bullet. I'm simply saying, _be ready_. Have your affairs in order. Have your soul ready in case you find yourself in trouble.

The pronouncements may seem dramatic, but they are not inappropriate for the moment in which we find ourselves. In their show of cruelty against minority populations at the behest of President Trump, masked ICE agents have started executing civilians. What the bishop is warning about here is that clergymen may be called by their faith to shield the innocent from ICE's bullets, Rachel Maddow explains.

> We have the Episcopal bishop in New Hampshire explaining that his clergy need to have their wills written and their affairs in order because they may be called to stand up against tyranny in the United States right now to the point of dangerousness, to the point where their lives may be at risk, to the point where he is talking about martyrdom in his church.

Rachel tells the story of Jonathan Daniels, an episcopal seminarian, who in 1965 shielded two black girls from the bullets of a racist who attempted to execute them. Trump has brought America back to a place where executions in the streets are once again conducted with impunity. Where there is carnage, there is martyrdom. Giving power to a tyrant comes with a terrible price.
