# Part Three. How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking

This part of [How to Win Friends and Influence People](../../../2026/01/19/how-to-win-friends.md) answered ten questions about meeting people, including meeting them halfway.

## How important is it to show your opponent that you are right and he is wrong? 

Much less important than having his good will. Being right is not the same thing as being effective, Ben Franklin argued.

> If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent’s good will.

To be effective one needs other people, and we can never get other people on our side if all we do is argue with them and point out to them what they got wrong.

> A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.

In the grand scheme of things, being right doesn't matter, a famous epitath reminds us.

> Here lies the body of William Jay, who died maintaining his right of way—he was right, dead right, as he sped along, but he’s just as dead as if he were wrong.

William Gibbs McAdoo reminds us that it is pointless to argue with a fool.

> it is impossible to defeat an ignorant man by argument.

Abraham Lincoln points out that the wounds incurred in an argument are not worth it.

> Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right.

When giving your critics the right of way, learn from the best. Learn from Elbert Hubbard. He knew just what to say when someone hurled a disagreement his way.

> Come to think it over, I don’t entirely agree with it myself. Not everything I wrote yesterday appeals to me today. I am glad to learn what you think on the subject.

## How to end an argument? 

By giving the person on the other side of the argument what they want: a feeling of importance. This is why they argue. If you give it to them without them having to get it out of you through argument, they may give you what you wanted without you having to argue for it either. Take an example of Mr. Parsons' tax inspector.

> He got his feeling of importance by loudly asserting his authority. But as soon as his importance was admitted and the argument stopped and he was permitted to expand his ego, he became a sympathetic and kindly human being.

## How to adequately assess a person's character? 

By finding out what makes him angry. This is why taking a date to a restaurant is a good idea: if they get into an argument with a waiter, beware: this is how they will soon treat you if you let this relationship continue.

> You can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry.

Better yet, watch their online presence. If they get joy out of trolling people, run.

## How to disagree politely?

Admit that you may be wrong and, if it matters this much to you, go over the facts with your adressee carefully, line by line.

> I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts.

Remember that no matter how convinced you are of being right, there's always a possibility that you're wrong.

> When we are right, let’s try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong—and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves—let us admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm. Not only will that technique produce astonishing results, but, believe it or not, it is a lot more fun, under the circumstances, than trying to defend ourselves. Remember the old proverb: “By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.”

## When accused of a misdeed, why could it be a good idea to confess to it and condemn yourself? 

Because this way, you're giving the person with the authority to punish you the option to instead grant you reprieve. Many will take this option because they can derive a greater feeling of self-importance out of it. To illustrate this point, the author recounted a story of encountering a policeman in the park and fessing up to a violation of a park ordinance to him.

> When I began to condemn myself, the only way he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the magnanimous attitude of showing mercy.

A reader told a similar story. He brought a problem to his supervisor but instead of taking the opportunity to blame someone else, he went out of his way to assure him that the blame was squarely on him.

> I walked into his office, told him that I had made a mistake, and then informed him of the complete facts. He replied in an explosive manner that it was the fault of the personnel department. I repeated that it was my fault. He exploded again about carelessness in the accounting department. Again I explained that it was my fault. He blamed two other people in the office. But each time I reiterated it was my fault. Finally, he looked at me and said, ‘Okay, it was your fault. Now straighten it out.’ The error was corrected and nobody got into trouble. I felt great because I was able to handle a tense situation and had the courage not to seek alibis. My boss has had more respect for me ever since.

To live free of fear is to live free of stress. It is to command the respect of everyone around you, including yourself. This is also the idea behind self-deprecation. If you say all the negative things about yourself that the other person is thinking, you're not hurt by it (because you're the one saying them), and the other person no longer has the ammunition they've been holding to use against you. Don't live in the fear of what others have against you. The ultimate act of owning what you are in the eyes of others is to give their negative words the frame that benefits you.

> If we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t it far better to beat the other person to it and do it ourselves? Isn’t it much easier to listen to self-criticism than to bear condemnation from alien lips? Say about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person is thinking or wants to say or intends to say—and say them before that person has a chance to say them. The chances are a hundred to one that a generous, forgiving attitude will be taken and your mistakes will be minimized.

## How to sell someone on your idea?

You can't sell someone on something because you can't impose your will on someone. You can only nudge them toward making the buying decision, but they can only make this decision themselves.

> People can’t be ‘sold.’ You have to let them buy.

If positioned correctly, such nudges almost always lead to a sale. Ask your prospects about their pain points. Let them talk at length. Carefully lead them toward your idea. The goal is for them to voice your idea themselves, a reader explains.

> I asked where they felt their problems were. We discussed each point, and I asked them their opinions on which was the best way to proceed. With a few low-key suggestions, at proper intervals, I let them develop my system themselves. At the end of the meeting when I actually presented my system, they enthusiastically accepted it. I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and much damage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she is wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of dignity and making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion.

Selling is like teaching. These projects fail when we forget that the key decisions in them are the responsibility of our addressees. Just as someone must make a conscious effort to learn something for you to be able to proclaim you have taught them, also _they_ must fully commit to buying something for you to have made a sale.

> No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.

If you respect your prospect's autonomy to choose your product, then that's probably what they'll do.

> Don’t you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself than in ideas that are handed to you on a silver platter? If so, isn’t it bad judgment to try to ram your opinions down the throats of other people? Isn’t it wiser to make suggestions—and let the other person think out the conclusion?

## How to tactfully negotiate down a price? 

Be complimentary to the salesperson and explain how much you like what he is selling but admit that you can't afford it. He might just take the hint. This can work even with a landlord, as the author tells from his personal experience.

> I complimented him on the way he ran the building and told him I should like very much to stay for another year but that I couldn’t afford it.

## How to get someone to agree to something? 

Get them used to saying yes to you. Before getting to your request, ask them at least two questions that they are sure to answer on the affirmative.

> In talking with people, do not begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing—and keep on emphasizing—the things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose. Get the other person saying “Yes, yes” at the outset. Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying “No.”

Harry Overstreet explains that this level of psychological conditioning works on the visceral level.

> This sets the psychological process of the listeners moving in the affirmative direction. It is like the movement of a billiard ball. Propel in one direction, and it takes some force to deflect it; far more force to send it back in the opposite direction. The psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person says ‘No’ and really means it, he or she is doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The entire organism—glandular, nervous, muscular—gathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable degree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on guard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says ‘Yes,’ none of the withdrawal activities take place. The organism is in a forward-moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more times we can induce ‘Yes’ at the very outset, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.

One reader shared his experience with the yes-yes technique by recounting a story of getting a bank teller to acceede to a request he would otherwise be more likely to deny.

> The young man’s attitude softened and changed when he realized that we weren’t asking for this information for our sake but for his.

Bank tellers like this are in rejection mode: they listen for customers' demands, and as soon as they hear them, they start coming up with reasons to reject them. The reader disarmed such a teller by asking him questions that broke this thought pattern. He put him in acceptance mode.

> By getting him to say ‘Yes, yes’ from the outset, he forgot the issue at stake and was happy to do all the things I suggested.

Another reader shared her success story about turning an unhappy customer into one that volunteered for an upsell. She got the customer to understand his user error by leading him to it through only two questions she knew he couldn't answer with no's. That's all it took to turn things around with a lucrative contact teetering on the verge of termination.

> “The chief engineer greeted me with this shocking announcement: ‘Allison, I can’t buy the remainder of the motors from you.’ “ ‘Why?’ I asked in amazement. ‘Why?’  “ ‘Because your motors are too hot. I can’t put my hand on them.’ “I knew it wouldn’t do any good to argue. I had tried that sort of thing too long. So I thought of getting the ‘Yes, yes,’ response. “ ‘Well, now look, Mr. Smith,’ I said. ‘I agree with you a hundred percent; if those motors are running too hot, you ought not to buy any more of them. You must have motors that won’t run any hotter than standards set by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. Isn’t that so?’ “He agreed it was. I had gotten my first ‘yes.’ “Then I said, ‘The Electrical Manufacturers Association regulations say that a properly designed motor may have a temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit above room temperature. Is that correct?’ “ ‘Yes,’ he agreed. ‘That’s quite correct. But your motors are much hotter.’ “I didn’t argue with him. I merely asked: ‘How hot is the mill room?’ “ ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.’ “ ‘Well,’ I replied, ‘if the mill room is 75 degrees and you add 72 to that, that makes a total of 147 degrees Fahrenheit. Wouldn’t you scald your hand if you held it under a spigot of hot water at a temperature of 147 degrees Fahrenheit?’ “Again he had to say ‘yes.’ “ ‘Well,’ I suggested, ‘wouldn’t it be a good idea to keep your hands off those motors?’ “ ‘Well, I guess you’re right,’ he admitted. We continued to chat for a while. Then he called his secretary and lined up approximately $35,000 worth of business for the ensuing month. “It took me years and cost me countless thousands of dollars in lost business before I finally learned that it doesn’t pay to argue, that it is much more profitable and much more interesting to look at things from the other person’s viewpoint and try to get that person saying ‘Yes, yes.’ ”

The Socratic method of educating people also relied on eliciting yes responses from them. This is how Socrates prepared his students or debate opponents to accept his points of view.

> He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree. He kept on winning one admission after another until he had an armful of yesses. He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously.

## How to make a favorable impression?

Do your homework prior to meeting the person you want to impress. Research the person you're meeting so you can get them talking about something they are passionate about. Then, sit back and listen to them talk. Nothing impresses people more than one's ability to let them feel important.

> Mr. Cubellis had taken the trouble to find out about the accomplishments of his prospective employer. He showed an interest in the other person and his problems. He encouraged the other person to do most of the talking—and, in doing so, made a favorable impression. The truth is, even our friends would much rather talk to us about their achievements than listen to us boast about ours. La Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said: “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.” Why is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, and trumpet our successes to them, it can arouse feelings of envy and even resentment. So let’s minimize our achievements. Let’s be modest. That always makes a hit. We ought to be modest, for both you and I will pass on and be completely forgotten a century from now. Life is too short to bore other people with talk of our petty accomplishments. Let’s encourage them to talk instead.

## How to foster integrity among your subordinates? 

Show them that you trust them.

> Appeal to the nobler motives.

They will rise up to meet your expectations, argued James L. Thomas.

> People are honest and want to discharge their obligations. The exceptions to that rule are comparatively few, and I am convinced that the individuals who are inclined to chisel will in most cases react favorably if you make them feel that you consider them honest, upright, and fair.
