This video was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). Its [transcript](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=62fe07ff9f2e6a607d107b8d5c2f918c) answered a question about trans culture.

## Why do people change their appearance? 

Because they want the world to see them as how they see themselves. Some older people go through plastic surgery because they still feel young inside, and they want the world to see that. Trans people see themselves as the opposite gender and change their appearance to get the world to see them that way.

> You're taking control of your appearance so that the world sees on the outside who you see on the inside. So I don't think, you know, dyeing your hair or wearing contacts is any different from what I do to be me, just a little less extreme.

We all make small tweaks to our appearance to get it more in line with how we feel, and what some may view as extreme transformations are simply extensions of that. To truly understand trans culture, one should start with understanding the reasons for their own look.
