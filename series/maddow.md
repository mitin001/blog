# [The Rachel Maddow Show](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/509873)

Google Podcasts recommended this podcast to me a few years ago. When I heard Rachel's sprawling A block, I felt like I was back in high school, in a history class. Fond memories.

Rachel is not particularly charitable in her analysis of the Trump administration, and for a good reason. Her extensive academic background in political science allows her to see the second Trump term as a shift in the American form of government from a uniquely powerful democratic republic to a common oligarchy, a shift destructive to the American ideals that have so far worked well for the benefit of its citizens and the world. There is still so much unrealized potential in the American democracy, and it shouldn't be squandered. As America heads toward its authoritarian future, Rachel is a voice of dissent. Concluding the American experiment while it's at its peak, just because one President was able to exploit the attention economy and was easily bought by foreign entities, is a regrettable waste. Rachel is doing her part to try to prevent this: she informs her audience of the implications of the Trump presidency and how to fight his destructive impulses.
