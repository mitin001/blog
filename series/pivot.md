Long ago, I saw a viral video of a [comedienne] storming out of an interview. Then, I saw [another interview] that she stormed out of, in another viral video. The comedienne was Joan Rivers. She soon became an obsession of mine. I watched everything she was in, including the [Comedy Central Roast of Joan Rivers], which was hosted by another comedienne, Kathy Griffin. She, too, became an obsession of mine. Having gone through everything with Joan Rivers, I then turned my attention to finding and watching everything with Kathy Griffin. This included the 8/2/2022 episode of the [Pivot] podcast, which Kathy Griffin co-hosted with Kara Swisher. I listened to many episodes of Pivot since then.
