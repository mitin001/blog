# Необъяснимо, но факт

A Russian television series full of fragments of other films and cool background music. I pay no attention to the content (because it is mostly conspiracy theory-level nonsense) and instead look at the mesmerizing montage and listen to the haunting music mixed with the beautiful voices of the host and narrator. It's a treat for your eyes and ears. This was on TV when I was little. I grew up on this stuff.
