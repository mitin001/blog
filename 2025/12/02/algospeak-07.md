# 7. It’s Giving Appropriation

This chapter of [Algospeak](../../../2025/11/20/algospeak.md) answered five questions about cultural and linguistic appropriation.

## Is there such a thing as correct English? 

No, as long as people who speak English can understand you, then you are speaking correct English, regardless of how it may be classified by the insiders and outsiders of your community.

> “Correct” English is a construct. The purpose of language is simply to be understood, and people can get their point across in many different ways. Even “correct” English is constantly shifting, borrowing words from “incorrect” dialects. The word “cool” used to be thought of as slang, but was eventually accepted as standard once its AAE origins were forgotten.

## What are the origins of the word _cool_?

African origins, same with related expressions like _chill out_.

> The West African concept of itutu, an aesthetic of beauty and calmness similarly associated with cold temperature. In Yoruba and Igbo society, itutu represented nonchalance in difficult situations, and this cultural attitude directly translated to art and expression in a segregated America; someone who was “cool” comported themselves attractively while subtly defying oppression.

Eventually, _cool_ became uncool and had to be replaced with _hip_ and _woke_, which have now also become either uncool or hijacked by trolls. The semantic treadmill is in full speed.

> Ironically, the perception of coolness is exactly what made the word “cool” spread in the first place. Since the term served to build in-group status for socially desirable subcultures, those adjacent to or interested in the subcultures began using it to feel like part of the group. However, once the word became mainstream, it started gradually losing cultural value to the Black community. While still an important concept, it no longer reflected in-group status and no longer alluded to awareness of systematic racism. That notion had to be expressed through other words such as “hip” and “woke”—both of which were also eventually repurposed by outside communities.

## Why do people of color invent so much more slang than white people? 

Because white people hold the most power. They don't need to resist anything. Slang is an act of resistance against the ones in power.

> The new vocabulary served as a concealed act of resistance against the straight white norms of the English language.

Slang allows a community to reclaim its linguistic power. However, slang is also catchy and will leak out of the community that uses it to identify its members, so once the masses adopt a slang word the community must replace it with another. And so, the Black community continues to churn out new slang words.

> The idea of a “correct” English language emerged from the upper-class East Midlands dialect of the U.K.—a dialect that didn’t represent the African diaspora in America, and yet one that was imposed on them. By creating new words for just themselves, the Black community has been able to reclaim their linguistic power. There remains a pressing social need to create new words, which is why white people have created proportionally less slang over the past hundred years. And yet, because Black culture remains “cool” in the American popular consciousness, much of its in-group vocabulary ends up being subsumed by general culture. AAE words, though stigmatized because they go against the accepted “standard” culture, are paradoxically seen as having linguistic prestige precisely because they’re part of the counterculture. As a result, they are borrowed by ever more mainstream groups until they’re finally normalized, at which point the in-group must make new words. This is the inevitable cycle of linguistic appropriation.

## Who comes up with the slang we encounter on social media?

It's either thought up in online discussion boards like 4chan or appropriated from African American English (AAE).

> If a word doesn’t come from 4chan, it’s probably from AAE.

Probably the highest degree of appropriation was seen by the slang of the queer Black community (the ballroom culture).

> To subtly disrespect someone was to “throw shade.” To demonstrate fierce femininity was to “give cunt.” To show immense talent or beauty was to “slay,” “work,” “serve,” or “eat it.” Gossip was “tea”; shocking someone was “gagging” them; successful performers were “icons” or “queens”; and yes was “yass.” If those terms seem familiar, it’s because they’re now all thought of as “internet slang.”

And now the ballroom slang is getting appropriated by white pop stars for financial gain.

> Meghan Trainor’s 2023 hit “Mother” (opening with a man calling her “literally mother right now”), had far more tangential connections to the community. Never mind that the word once had the implication of a matronly drag queen who would protect others in her house.

People of already significant privilege are furthering their privilege on the backs of those with very little of it.

> An early drag queen would never have called Meghan Trainor “mother.”

The queer Black community stands at an intersection of at least two vectors of oppression. There is not much they can do to fight it beyond inventing a dialect to feel closer to each other, but even that is being taken away from them. _Mother_ is no longer the drag queen who gave you a loving home when your own family disowned you. It is now some wealthy white pop star whose interaction with the gay community of color begins and ends on the stage.

> That association makes the word feel awkward to a lot of queer Black people.

Cultural appropriation is a violation of the norms of the group you're trying to steal from. You must earn your right to speak their language. There are rites of passage. Of course, the Internet and the anonymity that comes with it can circumvent all of that. The Internet is a fast, efficient vehicle of cultural appropriation.

> The online space makes in-groups feel more accessible by exposing users to more social circles than in real life, and then removes any regulatory ability from the original circles. If you were a straight white girl saying “slay” to someone in a real ball house in the 1990s, you likely would have gotten some funny looks and learned that the word wasn’t meant for you to say (then again, you likely wouldn’t have even known someone in a ball house). Today, it’s harder to tell when the vibe is off. You see ballroom videos online and feel as if they were speaking to you even when the intent was to speak to others in their in-group. Now you feel a connection to that group, but they have no connection back to you—and no ability to tell you when an appropriation is inappropriate. Today, even if you do say “slay” in a video, it’s going to reach people even further from the original community, with even less reason to believe they shouldn’t also say “slay.”

## Why is it common for sexual minorities to express themselves flamboyantly?

Because this is how they show the world that they do not accept being relegated by it. To see the extent of the urge to resist the marginalization by such individuals, look to the ballroom scene of the 1980s and 1990s, a community built by sexual and racial minorities.

> Queer Black joy was an act of resistance; it was an opportunity to celebrate identity in a way that challenged the white, cisgender norm of expression.
