# [Non-Ionizing Radiations – Sources, Biological Effects, Emissions and Exposures](https://emfsurvey.com/wp-content/uploads/Non-Ionizing-EMF-Radiation-Biological-Effects-Safety.pdf)

This report was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on non-ionizing radiation](../../../2025/12/01/wikipedia_non-ionizing_radiation.md). It answered a question about standards bodies for electromagnetic radiation.

## Why do regulatory agencies create guidelines for limiting workplace and general public exposures to electric and magnetic fields?

Because exposing one's body to these fields above certain strengths starts interfering with the body's internal processes. For example, the electric current induced by strong magnetic fields will interfere with electric action potentials by which the nervous system propagates signals. The induced electric current may also lead to observable effects in the circularity system and the action of the heart.

> Several guidelines have been proposed by international and national agencies based on criteria such as the need to limit currents induced by movement through the static magnetic field to levels less than those that occur naturally in the body or to limit those induced in the large vessels by blood flow to below levels that result in haemodynamic or cardiovascular effects.
