# [The summer I turned binge-y](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5646673)

This episode of [Planet Money](../../../2025/10/23/planet-money.md) answered a question about streamers and a question about service providers.

## What made Netflix executives to favor the drop (all episodes at once) rather than drip (an episode per week) approach to releasing seasons of television shows?

_Breaking Bad_.

> The night before season 5 of _Breaking Bad_ premiered, the final season, according to Netflix executives, they saw 50,000 people watch the entire fourth season ahead of the premiere.

This showed Netflix that people could binge an entire season of a show in one night, and so the execs decided that original Netflix shows would be released this way. People could now binge all episodes of a season shortly after its release by Netflix. All chapters of the proverbial book would be available to the audience at once, so to speak. This decision didn't detract from Netflix's spectacular success because this company has had a handful of very successful shows that have paid for all the whims of its execs, with plenty left over.

> How, Wailin, do we go from a company that is now on the verge of not just including _Casablanca_ in their streaming offerings, but owning the movie studio that made _Casablanca_? That, I will argue, all comes down to just a few key moments and a few key television shows in the history of Netflix.

Tail events drive everything from natural selection to the economy.

## How to negotiate a better price with a service provider?

It might be wise to remind them that customer acquisition is expensive whereas customer retention is cheap.

> You want to hang on to people because it's quite expensive to get them back. You then have to send them-- I don't know-- all the promos and all the marketing. And it's expensive to do that.

"We both want to keep your company's churn to a minimum. Let me do my part to help. I can't afford your service at the announced price, but if you make it more affordable for me, I wouldn't have to leave."
