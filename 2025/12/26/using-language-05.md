# 5. Meaning and understanding

This chapter of [Using Language](../../../2025/12/14/using-language.md) answered three questions about how we communicate.

## Can linguistic communication be adequately understood without the perspective of the listener?

The author concedes that such attempts have been made (by John Searle), but he then proceeds to call them absurd.

> Linguistic communication is like writing a letter and dropping it in the mail. It doesn't matter whether anybody receives, reads, or understands it. This view is, of course, absurd. There can be no communication without listeners taking actions too - without them understanding what speakers mean.

If a tree falls in the forest and no one sees it, does it count? If someone speaks into the void without a listener, is anything communicated? Perhaps, something is communicated to oneself, but in that case, there's a listener (the one who assumes both the role of the listener and the speaker), so the act of communication is valid. Communication is a joint action: the conversation evolves in coordination between the speaker and listener.

> This is nothing less than a coordinated action by the addressees.

Even the decisions made in communicating information initially depend on how the listener is reacting to it.

> Suppose Ann assumes Ben knows Dutch and says "Ga je even..." when Ben interrupts with "What?" before she can finish "zitten alsjeblieft." Although she begins her utterance intending Ben to recognize that she wants him to sit down, she is forced to abort that intention undischarged when she realizes Ben isn't doing his part.

Paul Grice argued that the purpose of communication is not merely one intended by the speaker but one that is common to both the speaker and the listener; it is emergent.

> Our talk exchanges do not normally consist of a succession of disconnected remarks, and would not be rational if they did. They are characteristically, to some degree at least, cooperative efforts; and each participant recognizes in them, to some extent, a common purpose.

A speaker may attempt to communicate information with one intention and then discover that it's being taken by the listener to mean something else, which changes the direction of the communication. If your conversational contribution goes against the purpose in which the conversation is trending, you risk being viewed as disruptive to the conversation, especially if you make such attempts repeatedly. This is particularly common in anonymous online settings—breeding grounds for trolls. To not be a troll is to align yourself with the common purpose of the participants in the conversation or discourse.

## Why do people speak in riddles?

Riddles are conversational implicatures intentionally or unintentionally taken to an extreme. We speak in conversational implicatures because we want cooperation from the listener.

> They are calculable. Speakers intend addressees to be able to work them out.

For example, when you say that the garage is right around the corner, your listener is to work out that it's open.

> Conversational implicatures are those parts of what speakers mean that addressees recognize only by "working them out."

We speak in conversational implicatures because we don't want to expend too much effort or spend too much time crafting our communications to be as easily understood as possible. Instead, we say only as much as needed for the listener to them be able to work out the rest of the meaning. Conversations are ephemeral; they consist of a series of quick joint actions. If the speaker took too long to craft an utterance, it would derail the conversation. So, the speaker offloads some one the communication construction-deconstruction effort to the listener. With conversational implicatures, the load of the conversation is balanced at the expense of some information inevitably getting lost in miscalculation. 

## What is perlocution?

An act of using language to get someone to do something. Perlocution encapsulates illocution (the speaker's intent), which encapsulates locution (the literal meaning of the words), which encapsulates rhetics (use of words with a given sense and reference), which encapsulate phatics (the words), which encapsulate phonetics (the sounds of which words are made).

John Austin coined the term _illocution_ not as the opposite of _locution_ but as a contraction of "into locution" as in "putting some intent into one's locution."

> I am asking you to sit down not _by_ saying “Please sit down,” but _in_ saying that. This is why Austin used the Latin prefix in- in coining the term illocutionary act.
