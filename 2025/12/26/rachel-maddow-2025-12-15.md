This episode of [Rachel Maddow](../../../2025/11/01/rachel-maddow.md) answered a question about retaining access to healthcare during Trump's reign.

## What to do when an authoritarian destroys federal institutions in charge of public health? 

Turn to your local public health institutions. If you live in a red state that follows Trump's lead, then come to a blue state to make decisions about your health. That's where you might also find the talent that has exited the federal institutions. For example, after Dr. Debra Houry resigned from the CDC in protest of the Trump administration turning that agency into a promoter of conspiracy theories, she was swiftly hired by the State of California to join its Public Health Network Innovation Exchange.

> If you want your public health run by doctors and public health experts instead of realtors and aviation attorneys, turn to a blue state near you.
