# [A conversation with Rachel Maddow and Timothy Snyder](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/509873?episode=46669092066): [12/13/2025](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=5bd7c520e2ea666ed534df7ba2ffcbd6)

This live event shared by [Rachel Maddow](../../../2025/11/01/rachel-maddow.md) answered two questions about Trump's most unconscionable policies: the silencing of his critics and the cruelty to immigrants.

## Why did Trump go after prestige law firms?

To preempt any attempt they might make to legally challenge his actions while in office (deportations of people without due process, terminations of non-political appointments before their terms expire, etc).

> If anybody's wondering why Trump went after fancy law firms, it was in part to try to, I think, neuter that as a tactic of those who are opposed to him.

## How is Trump's cruelty to undocumented immigrants a canary in the coalmine for the rest of us? 

Authoritarians use undocumented people as test subjects for their most cruel and usual ideas of punishment for their citizens.

> There is a long tradition of using undocumented people as a first step towards creating zones of statelessness, zones where the law doesn't apply. The Nazi regime in Germany, as almost nobody remembers, its first really large-scale act of oppression was the deportation in the autumn of 1938 of undocumented people, undocumented Jews.

This was the first step toward concentration camps. The worst of WWII is already here, but it goes by a different name.

> Concentration camps, or as we prefer to call them, detention centers.
