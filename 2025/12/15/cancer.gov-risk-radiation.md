# [Risk Factors for Cancer: Radiation](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation)

This article was referenced by [an FAQ on cell phones and cancer](../../../2025/11/27/cancer.gov-cell-phones-fact-sheet.md). It answered four questions about diagnostic and therapeutic uses of ionizing radiation.

## How are chest x-rays taken?

A beam of x-rays is shone on a person's chest. As they pass through the person's body, the photons that haven't gotten absorbed by the body are captured by film or its digital equivalent directly behind the person.

> An x-ray is a type of high-energy radiation that can pass through the body and onto film or a computer, making pictures of areas inside the body.

## What is a CT scan?

Computed tomography. A machine takes many x-ray images of the patient's body and then reconstructs 3-dimensional models of the body.

> A procedure that uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-dimensional (3-D) views of tissues and organs. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the tissues and organs show up more clearly.

The machinery of a CT scan is more extensive than that used for an ordinary x-ray. A person lies inside a large machine, which moves the patient through it as needed.

> The patient lies on a table that slides through the CT machine, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the body.

## What is a PET scan? 

Positron emission tomography. It's like a CT scan, except the radiation beam comes from inside the patient's body rather than from the machine behind it.

> A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the patient's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body. Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.

## How does radiation therapy treat cancer? 

Like cures like. Radiation damages the DNA of cancer cells, which kills them. A negative externality of such treatment is that it may damage the DNA of adjacent healthy cells, and it is precisely DNA damage that causes cancer. 

> Cancer patients may want to talk with their doctors about how radiation treatment could increase their risk for a second cancer later on.
