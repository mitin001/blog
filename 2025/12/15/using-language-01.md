# 1. Language Use

This chapter of [Using Language](../../../2025/12/14/using-language.md) answered five questions about the lessons language can teach us about life, society, and responsibility.

## When an individual makes a mistake in his job deliverable that goes on to hurt the customer, who is liable for it?

The company is responsible. The employee hands the deliverable to them as is in exchange for the wage. From that point on, it is the company's responsibility to ensure the deliverable won't hurt their customers. This is true of any product, even written reports.

> Although one person may have composed the words, it is the institution — the ad agency, drug company, or legislature — that is ultimately responsible, approving the wording as faithful to the institution's collective intentions.

If ChatGPT is given access to the Internet where it all l autonomously spreads malware, we don't treat ChatGPT as a sentient being for the purposes of holding it liable for the damage. That would be absurd. Instead, it is OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, who would be held responsible for the actions of their chatbot.

## Can children learn their first language from television alone?

No, for the first two to three years of life, children learn almost exclusively from face-to-face conversation with people around them, not screens, the research cited by the author suggests.

> Children may learn some language from other media, but they apparently cannot learn their first language from radio or television alone.

## Why is it that sometimes people who've never before spoken to each other can understand each other deeply at their very first conversation?

Because they happened to be sharing a vast common ground. This is atypical, but it can happen. Typically, common ground develops between people as they spend more time together (e.g., they can reference shared experiences).

> The more time Alan and Barbara spend together, the larger their common ground. Every social activity Alan and Barbara engage in takes place on this common ground.

However, since much of our reality is shared, we can find common ground with anyone. Some interactions begin with a discovery of multiple points of commonality, and those interactions typically lead to a greater understanding and deeper connection. This gives the relationship a head start, and it can only strengthen from there. Because communication requires coordination (and common ground allows for a finer control of coordination), communication is awkward without there being sufficient common ground.

> Shaking hands, smiling at one another, waltzing, and even walking past each other without bumping all require them to coordinate their actions, and they cannot coordinate their actions without rooting them in their common ground.

Because the aim of any linguistic process is communication, it only makes sense to think of anything to do with language as an activity that emerges out of an interaction of multiple people. Thinking of language as a solitary action is just as awkward as imagining someone waltzing alone.

> When Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers waltz, they each move around the ballroom in a special way. But waltzing is different from the sum of their individual actions — imagine Astaire and Rogers doing the same steps but in separate rooms or at separate times. Waltzing is the joint action that emerges as Astaire and Rogers do their individual steps in coordination, as a couple. Doing things with language is likewise different from the sum of a speaker speaking and a listener listening. It is the joint action that emerges when speakers and listeners or writers and readers perform their individual actions in coordination, as ensembles. Language use, therefore, embodies both individual and social processes.

This is why the better we are at speaking a language, the better we are at finding common ground with people. When we enlist a person in this joint action, we soon discover our first points of commonality with that person.

## What is the proper way to conduct one's life? 

Play by its rules. For example, in conversation, as in all life, if it is to be effective, the speakers must take turns and advance it by properly responding to what was previously said. Nothing worthwhile comes from ignoring the other speaker, speaking out of turn, or trying to prolong a conversation that has ended. The proper way to live life resembles a proper conversation: after taking an action, appreciate all the externalities and the unintended consequences of your action and address them in your next action. Do not pretend they don't exist. Let life guide you. Live one step at a time. Take one step; then, let the universe take the next one before you make your next move. That's how you let the universe guide your life.

> When we take an action, we foresee, even intend, many of its consequences, but other consequences simply emerge. That is, actions have two broad products: anticipated products and emergent products.

Proper conversations can land you in marvelous places, with marvelous people entering your circle of friends. Proper responses to life's challenges can lead to similarly spectacular results. If the anticipated products of your actions don't materialize, make the best of the emergent products.

## What is language? 

A tool for carrying out social activities.

> Language fundamentally is used for social purposes. People don't just use language. They use language for doing things – gossiping, getting to know each other, planning daily chores, transacting business, debating politics, teaching and learning, entertaining each other, holding trials in court, engaging in diplomacy, and so on. These are social activities, and language is an instrument for helping carry them out. Languages as we know them wouldn't exist if it weren't for the social activities they are instrumental in.

Note that language is more than a tool for merely exchanging information. It's a tool for exchanging attention and everything else that frames our social bonds.
