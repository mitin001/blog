# 2. Joint activities

This chapter of [Using Language](../../../2025/12/14/using-language.md) answered three questions about language and its use in capturing joint activities.

## Is language a means to an end or an end itself?

A means to an end. Language is a tool. Whenever we use language, we later recount it not as an instance of using language but as an instance of getting something from someone. Language enables an exchange (of ideas, goods, attention, etc) between people, but we never place language as at the center of such an exchange.

> Language use arises in joint activities. You call up your sister for an address, or talk to a friend about what to take on a picnic, or discuss news with a colleague. If you were later asked “What did you do?” you wouldn’t describe your acts of speaking. You would describe the joint activities you took part in. “I got an address from my sister.” “My friend and I decided what to bring on a picnic.” “A colleague and I traded gossip.” In each case, you take the joint activity to be primary, and the language you used along the way to be secondary, a means to an end.

As the author would put it, language is an emergent product of joint activities.

## Is a game of chess more than just a set of chess moves?

Yes, any human activity includes official states and events (e.g., chess moves) as well as unofficial ones.

> Chess moves are official parts of the game because they are added to the official trace, alter the official board, and advance the game. In fact, a trace, or record, of the moves is all we formally need to know about a game; it is what is reproduced in chess books and studied by chess aficionados. Other actions may become public even though they play no official role in the game. When Morphy adjusted a piece on the board, moaned over a blunder, sipped water, or took a long time on a move, these were added to Morphy’s and Anderssen’s common ground, but as information outside the game proper.

Any activity involving humans has layers of complexity. Even as the players perform a formal task of advancing a game of chess by making their moves, they're also spending time together, socializing, and expanding their common ground (learning about each other, etc). Unofficial states and events can even influence the subsequent chess moves thereby affecting the game's formal representation. Humans take everything into account when making decisions, formal or otherwise. That includes information from every layer of complexity arising from the joint activity.

## When transcribing a conversation, does the transcriber have to note when pauses were taken by speakers? 

Yes, anything that conveys communicated information should ideally be included in the transcript as annotations. Pauses convey reluctance.

> If I had produced “Okay” with no delay, I would have meant “I accept without conditions,” but if I had let one second pass first, I would have shown impatience and meant “I accept only reluctantly.”
