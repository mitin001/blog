This episode of [Real Time](../../../2025/10/16/real-time.md) answered a question about Bill Maher and a question about Mel Robbins.

## Have the Democrats lost Bill Maher's vote?

Not yet. Even though Bill Maher often criticizes the Democratic Party, he still votes for their candidates. He voted for Kamala Harris in 2024.

> As I like to remind my very pure friends, we voted for the same person. You're just why she lost.

As Maher sees it, the Democratic Party sets impossible standards for their electorate: safetyism (car seats for children, masks outside, etc), forcing cis people to be constantly telling other cis people their pronouns, pretending there has been no progress on civil rights, etc.

## What is Mel Robbins' Let Them theory?

Start living your life with a carefree attitude. Every time someone tries to take you out of it with their annoying behavior, just let them do what they do without it having any effect on you.

> Once you start saying "let them," and you protect your time and energy from other people, and you also force yourself to accept people as they are.

Stop trying to change people.

> If you're going to go home and spend time with your family, stop gripping the wheel hoping it's different. These people have been the same their whole lives.
