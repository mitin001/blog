# 2. What Sorts of Bullshit Jobs Are There?

This chapter of [Bullshit Jobs](../../../2025/12/13/bullshit-jobs.md) answered seven questions about a society that's advanced so much it's become beholden to bullshit props and manufactured demand.

## What do people do at bullshit jobs? 

They forward emails. They pass them around from one bullshitter to the next, sometimes without even bothering to read them or comment on them.

> My new “job” basically consists of my boss forwarding emails to me with the message “Steve refer to the below,” and I reply that the email is inconsequential or straight-up spam.

They pick on the most junior employees, offloading all their responsibilities on to them.

> A perverse dynamic began to set in, whereby managers off-loaded more and more of their responsibilities onto the lowest-ranking female subordinate (her) to give the impression that they were too busy to do such things themselves, leading, of course, to their having even less to do than previously—a spiral culminating in the apparently bizarre decision to hire another manager to stare at the wall or play Pokémon all day, just because hiring him would make it look like that was not what everyone else was doing.

They multiply. They hire new bullshitters for no reason other than to provide cover for their bullshit, a holder of one such job argues.

> I got paid to be bored.

At bullshit jobs, people get paid to shovel around bullshit. Such bullshit is made up of words and figures, another corporate consultant argues.

> I look forward to the day that someone in my industry steps up and goes full Sokal affair—i.e., submits a consulting report that is entirely made up of vague business buzzwords, and doesn’t actually contain any structured information at all. Although I suspect this has already happened many times, just without the consultants in question being conscious of it.

When people create bullshit for a living, what they're really doing is creating props for people more powerful than they are to play out their working lives with just the degree of theatricality they desire.

> Apparently, if you are suing a doctor for malpractice, part of the show involves assembling an impressive pile of scientific papers to plunk down on the table at an appropriately theatrical moment and then enter into evidence. While everyone knows that no one will actually read these papers, there is always the possibility that the defense attorney or one of his expert witnesses might pick one up at random for inspection—so it is considered important to ensure your legal aides locate articles that can at least plausibly be said to bear in some way on the case.

## How to detect whether a given report is bullshit? 

Look for the overuse of the words characteristic of bullshitters: _strategic_, _quality_, _excellence_, _leadership_, _stakeholder_, etc.

> Those of us toiling in the academic mills who still like to think of ourselves as teachers and scholars before all else have come to fear the word “strategic.” “Strategic mission statements” (or even worse, “strategic vision documents”) instill a particular terror, since these are the primary means by which corporate management techniques—setting up quantifiable methods for assessing performance, forcing teachers and scholars to spend more and more of their time assessing and justifying what they do and less and less time actually doing it—are insinuated into academic life. The same suspicions hold for any document that repeatedly uses the words “quality,” “excellence,” “leadership,” or “stakeholder.”

## Does capitalism create bullshit jobs?

You can say that, but David Graeber chooses not to.

> I avoid attributing agency to abstractions.

A large group of geographically distributed people in executive and management positions create bullshit jobs, not a system. People have agency, systems don't.

## Why do managers hire people into positions they know to be bullshit?

For the same reason nobility in highland Madagascar surrounded themselves with people in life and in death: for status.

> Wherever one found the tomb of a famous nobleman, one also invariably found two or three modest graves directly at its foot. When I asked what these modest graves were, I would always be told these were his “soldiers”—really a euphemism for “slaves.” The meaning was clear: to be an aristocrat meant to have the power to order others around. Even in death, if you didn’t have underlings, you couldn’t really claim to be a noble. An analogous logic seems to be at work in corporate environments.

A modern-day corporate manager surrounds himself with a posse of note-takers and slide-deck decorators.

> Just as the retinues of a feudal lord might include servants whose only role was to polish his horses’ armor or tweeze his mustache before tournaments or pageants, so may present-day executives keep employees whose sole purpose is to prepare their PowerPoint presentations or craft the maps, cartoons, photographs, or illustrations that accompany their reports. Many of these reports are nothing more than props in a Kabuki-like corporate theater—no one actually reads them all the way through. But this doesn’t stop ambitious executives from cheerfully shelling out half a workman’s yearly wages of company money just to be able to say, “Ooh yes, we commissioned a report on that.”

If the rich and powerful don't keep people busy in bullshit jobs, they might rise up against the system that keeps them rich and powerful.

> Imagine you are a feudal class extracting 50 percent of every peasant household’s product. If so, you are in possession of an awful lot of food. Enough, in fact, to support a population exactly as large as that of peasant food producers. You have to do something with it—and there are only so many people any given feudal lord can keep around as chefs, wine stewards, scullery maids, harem eunuchs, musicians, jewelers, and the like. Even after you’ve taken care to ensure you have enough men trained in the use of weapons to suppress any potential rebellion, there’s likely to be a great deal left over. As a result, indigents, runaways, orphans, criminals, women in desperate situations, and other dislocated people will inevitably begin to accumulate around your mansion (because, after all, that’s where all the food is). You can drive them away, but then they’re likely to form a dangerous vagabond class that might become a political threat. The obvious thing to do is to slap a uniform on them and assign them some minor or unnecessary task. It makes you look good, and at least that way, you can keep an eye on them.

And yet, corporations claim to be cults of efficiency. It's believed they're always looking to trim the fat. In reality, they're cults of making managers feel important. The sole responsibility of trendy roles in a corporation is to validate the status of said corporation. Their role is decorative, not functional. It's not a real company unless it has the same kind of bloat as all the other companies have.

> Countries need armies only because other countries have armies. If no one had an army, armies would not be needed. But the same can be said of most lobbyists, PR specialists, telemarketers, and corporate lawyers.

## Is there a company that could serve as a model for not having bullshit jobs? 

Your next company could be like that if you follow the example of the Mexican Armed Forces.

> One might argue that most countries also maintain armies to suppress real or potential civil unrest, but this rarely involves a need for fighter jets, submarines, or MX missiles. Historically, Mexico has had an explicit policy of not wasting money on such expensive toys, arguing that owing to their geographic position, the only countries they’d be likely to enter into hostilities with would be either the USA, or Guatemala. If they went to war with the USA, they’d lose, pretty much regardless of armament; if they went to war with Guatemala, they’d win, with or without fighter jets. Hence, Mexico merely maintains such equipment as would suffice to suppress domestic dissent.

Mexico doesn't need to intimidate Guatemala, and it's no use to try to intimidate the USA. When you are deciding who you need to hire into your company, learn from Mexico and ask yourself whether you can do without keeping people on the payroll for no other reason than to validate your company's legitimacy against the backdrop of other companies who have already fallen into this trap.

## If there's demand for a product, does it mean that it fulfills a legitimate need?

No, demand isn't necessarily created by a need. It can be manufactured. A reader who works in advertising argues that most demand is manufactured.

> I consider a worthwhile job to be one that fulfills a preexisting need, or creates a product or service that people hadn’t thought of, that somehow enhances and improves their lives. I believe we passed the point where most jobs were these type of jobs a long time ago. Supply has far outpaced demand in most industries, so now it is demand that is manufactured. My job is a combination of manufacturing demand and then exaggerating the usefulness of the products sold to fix it. In fact, you could argue that that is the job of every single person that works in or for the entire advertising industry. If we’re at the point where in order to sell products, you have to first of all trick people into thinking they need them, then I think you’d be hard-pressed to argue that these jobs aren’t bullshit.

Most consumer spending is unnecessary. Very little demand is due to legitimate needs of the consumer. People spend all day looking at unattainable standards of beauty and living, punctuated by commercial breaks that promise (falsely) to get them to reach those standards.

> We essentially make viewers feel inadequate whilst they’re watching the main programs and then exaggerate the effectiveness of the “solutions” provided in the commercial breaks.

## Why do companies rely so much on open-source software rather than developing their own proprietary software? 

Because so much of the engineering effort goes into duct taping the free software together to fulfill an organization's needs that there's no time left for the development of in-house software. Meanwhile, this job is so unfulfilling that the developers doing it are willing to contribute to the open-source software for free, if only to find some fulfillment. Corporations are among the first beneficiaries of such an arrangement, so there's no incentive for them to change anything about it.

> The growing reliance on free software (freeware), paid employment is increasingly reduced to duct taping. Coders are often happy to perform the interesting and rewarding work on core technologies for free at night but, since that means they have less and less incentive to think about how such creations will ultimately be made compatible, that means the same coders are reduced during the day to the tedious (but paid) work of making them fit together.

The development of the open-source community is a modern-day equivalent of housewife’s neurosis. Developers clean up the mess in the codebases of large corporations (their tech debt), and in being forced to perform this tedious and thankless labor, they become disgruntled, to the point where they'd rather write software for free, even if it's at nights or during weekends, just because it's good software (in contrast to the slop they're moving around during business hours).

> Cleaning is a necessary function: things get dusty even if they just sit there, and the ordinary conduct of life tends to leave traces that need to be tidied up. But cleaning up after someone who makes a completely gratuitous and unnecessary mess is always irritating. Having a full-time occupation cleaning up after such a person can only breed resentment. Sigmund Freud even spoke of “housewife’s neurosis”: a condition that he believed affected women forced to limit their life horizons to tidying up after others, and who therefore became fanatical about domestic hygiene as a form of revenge. This is often the moral agony of the duct taper: to be forced to organize one’s working life around caring about a certain value (say, cleanliness) precisely because more important people could not care less. The most obvious examples of duct tapers are underlings whose jobs are to undo the damage done by sloppy or incompetent superiors.
