This episode of [Pivot](../../../2025/10/14/pivot.md) answered a question about mergers and acquisitions.

## If you're acquiring a company, are you maximizing your shareholder value?

Likely no. If you're a CEO, remember that you answer to your shareholders.

> Two-thirds of acquisitions do not pay off.

This spooks the market. For this reason, mergers and acquisitions have a adverse effect on the company's shares.

> Stocks fall when they get into the M&A race.

Mergers and acquisitions are becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. They tank small companies because that's what the market expects of them. In this mindset, the market will not let a small company find profitability in its acquisition. The stock of Bigtincan fell precipitously when it acquired Modus (and others). Things got so bad that soon Bigtincan was itself for sale. The CEO was replaced. The shareholders must've decided that their interests weren't being served.
