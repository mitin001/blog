# [What qualifies as a serious trans-exclusionary argument for Stock](https://web.archive.org/web/20210112101755/https://twitter.com/ergo_praxis/status/1043735465004654592)

This thread was referenced by [a post about Kathleen Stock](../../../2025/11/10/praile-kathleen-stock-obe.md). It answered a question about trans rights.

## Should trans women be allowed in women's bathrooms? 

Yes. Even the people most vehemently opposed to the inclusion of trans women in women-only spaces (transphobic propagandists) have failed to come up with a coherent argument to exclude them.

> If we took transphobic propaganda seriously, we would be compelled to conclude that we have to exclude all women from spaces reserved for women, for the protection of women from women, since at least some women might victimize some other women.

Kathleen Stock advances the view that trans women should be excluded from women-only spaces because they could harm women in those spaces.

> She's saying that all trans women should be excluded from spaces reserved for women because at least *some* (would one do?) trans women will invariably or possibly (!) victimize cis women, as indeed at least some members of any group would or might victimize members of any other.

She doesn't establish that trans women as a group of people are more dangerous to women than cis women themselves are dangerous to each other.

> She's showing neither that trans women are dangerous because they are trans women (she claims to deny this), nor that trans women are more likely to victimize cis women than e.g. cis persons.

It follows from Stock's argument that if anyone from group A ever harms a woman in a woman-only space, then everyone from group A must be excluded from such spaces. What's stopping us from assigning cis women to "group A" thereby excluding everyone from women-only spaces?

> By her lights, it's enough that it is certain (or possible!) that some person, that happens to belong in a group A, will victimize some person that happens to be a cis woman, to entitle us to exclude all members of group A, including women, from spaces reserved for women.
