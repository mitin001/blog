# [Limiting exposure to time-varying electric and magnetic fields](https://www.icnirp.org/cms/upload/publications/ICNIRPLFgdl.pdf)

This scholarly paper was referenced by [an FAQ on radiofrequency radiation and cancer](../../../2025/12/18/cancer.gov-electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet.md). It answered two questions about physics.

## Does 50 Hz radiation from power lines have thermal effects on your body?

Not practically. They're none to negligible. When ICNIRP established the guidelines for safety around electromagnetic radiation, it didn't see any thermal effects below 100 kHz to be worthy of consideration.

## How to determine the force exerted on a given object?

Find out the strength of the field in the region of space containing the object. The force will be proportional to it. We live in a world of fields. A physical action increases or decreases the strength of a field affected by it. For example, movement of a massive object increases the strength of the gravitational field in the region of space toward which it is moving (or it decreases it when moving away). Because we share a region of space with planet Earth, we strongly feel the gravitational field created by it. The gravitational field exerts a force (gravity) on every massive particle in our bodies. Similarly, movement of a charged particle toward a region of space increases the electric field in that region, which affects other charged particles in it. If a particle with the charge of 1 Coulomb is in an electric field with the strength of 1 V/m, then it exerts the force of 1 N on it, that is, if its mass is 1 kg, it will accelerate by 1 m/s² in the direction of decreasing field strength. This is why electrons move from areas of high electron concentrations (voltage) to areas of low electron concentrations, a principle we rely on to power our electronic devices.

> An electric field, E, exerts a force on an electric charge and is expressed in volts per meter.

Different fields interact with their target particles differently. The gravitational field causes massive objects to move in the direction of increasing field strength. The electric field causes charged particles to move in the direction of decreasing field strength. The magnetic field only affects charged particles when its in flux.

> Magnetic fields can exert physical forces on electric charges, if such charges are in motion and/or the magnetic field varies with time.

The human body significantly perturbs the electric field (at least at low frequencies), indicating a presence of a high number of charged particles in the body.

> Human and animal bodies significantly perturb the spatial distribution of a low frequency electric field. At low frequencies, the body is a good conductor, and the perturbed field lines external to the body are nearly perpendicular to the body surface.

However, the body doesn't significantly perturb the magnetic field indicating that the movement of those charged particles is limited to short distances.
