# 3. Joint actions

This chapter of [Using Language](../../../2025/12/14/using-language.md) answered three questions about cooperation and language.

## How do people cooperate? 

People cooperate when they're motivated by a common goal. They adapt their autonomous individual actions to participatory actions in accordance with the set goal.

> Two people have a coordination problem whenever they have common interests, or goals, and each person’s actions depend on the actions of the other. To reach their goals, they have to coordinate their individual actions in a joint action. In this view, joint actions are created from the goal backward. Two people realize they have common goals, realize their actions are interdependent, and work backward to find a way of coordinating their actions in a joint action that will reach those goals.

Joint actions consist of individual actions performed in synchrony such that an emergent effect of their actions aligns with the intentions of both participants.

> An ensemble can do things that it cannot intend to do.

Effects of two district individual actions are easier to predict than an effect of one joint action. This is because a joint action is much more than a sum of individual autonomous actions. They must be synchronized in a nontrivial way. There's no central agent deciding on whether the emergent effect matches the intended one; there are two distinct participants whose individual experiences are considerably more vast then their common ground. The more common ground two people share, the easier it is for them to cooperate. This is in line with Thomas Schelling's argument that the outcome of a joint action depends on how well the participants can anticipate each other's actions.

> What is necessary is to coordinate predictions, to read the same message in the common situation, to identify the one course of action that their expectations of each other can converge on. They must "mutually recognize" some unique signal that coordinates their expectations of each other.

Both participants in a joint action must be able to predict what action the other will take and when. Their goals must be in perfect alignment. The common goal can be anything, as long as it's what both of the participants have in mind, Thomas Schelling argues.

> Finding the key, or rather finding a key — any key that is mutually recognized as the key becomes the key — may depend on imagination more than on logic.

When you share a vast common ground, you can understand each other better. The expressive power of your language is stronger, and the volume of information conveyed in a sentence is larger. You have more words and meanings at your disposal.

> For Ann to tell Ben “I Houdini’d my way out of the closet,” she must suppose they share salient biographical facts about Harry Houdini, the great escape artist.

The common ground includes not only pop culture references but also shared experiences.

> For her to say “Max went too far this time and teapotted a policeman” and by “teapot” mean “rub the back of with a teapot,” she must suppose she and Ben share knowledge of Max’s peculiar penchant for sneaking up behind people and rubbing them with a teapot.

## Why do Americans say they live _on_ a given street whereas the British say they live _in_ a given street? Why the different prepositions?

Because of the differences in how the convention for defining a street has evolved in these places. In America, a street is thought of as a line whereas in Britain, it is thought of as a region of land.

> In Britain, a street is conceived of as an area that includes the roadway and the adjacent land on which the houses sit. So the British say, "My house is in Maiden Lane." In North America, a street is conceived of as a one-dimensional roadway that the adjacent land and houses touch. So North Americans say, "My house is on Maiden Lane."

## Why must we always define the terms we intend to use in scholarly writing?

To avoid ambiguity. To establish explicit agreement with the reader over the precise nature of the objects discussed in the writing.

> To preempt conventions that would otherwise apply.

The purpose of scholarly writing is often to challenge established convention. Scholarly writing often reports on findings that no longer align with conventional wisdom. Therefore, the terms that may be familiar to readers must be redefined, at least in the scope of what is being reported.

> Any convention of language can be preempted by stipulation.

Such stipulations often result in the academic language of a given discipline becoming code indecipherable by the uninitiated.

> This is the basis for private codes among spies.

To familiarize one with such a code, one must read not only the paper but a trail of references (as well as their references). During this process, the person catches on to the code and how it's used, i.e., becomes initiated into the academic discipline. Eventually, the words that were once explicitly stipulated become conventional in the academic discipline, and by this point, their meanings in the discipline will have often strayed significantly from those that are conventional to the general public (e.g., what the word _theory_ means to a scientist vs. a lay person).

> Entrainment of terms like this is ubiquitous in conversation – powerful evidence for precedent as a major source of coordination in language use.

If we don't conform to conventions established by precedent, we risk misunderstanding. As a result, our voice could be excluded from the discourse. This is why when we write academic papers, we must be careful not to define too many terms anew and instead borrow definitions from our references, even as those definitions stray significantly from conventional wisdom.
