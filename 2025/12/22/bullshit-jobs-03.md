# 3. Why Do Those in Bullshit Jobs Regularly Report Themselves Unhappy?

This chapter of [Bullshit Jobs](../../../2025/12/13/bullshit-jobs.md) answered six questions better suited for anthropology than economic theory.

## Can economic theory explain all human behavior?

No, it can only explain the ideal model of rational human behavior. Most human behavior strays significantly from this model.

> According to classical economic theory, homo oeconomicus, or “economic man”—that is, the model human being that lies behind every prediction made by the discipline—is assumed to be motivated above all by a calculus of costs and benefits. All the mathematical equations by which economists bedazzle their clients, or the public, are founded on one simple assumption: that everyone, left to his own devices, will choose the course of action that provides the most of what he wants for the least expenditure of resources and effort. It is the simplicity of the formula that makes the equations possible: if one were to admit that humans have complicated motivations, there would be too many factors to take into account, it would be impossible to properly weight them, and predictions could not be made. Therefore, while an economist will say that while of course everyone is aware that human beings are not really selfish, calculating machines, assuming that they are makes it possible to explain a very large proportion of what humans do, and this proportion—and only this—is the subject matter of economic science.

The problem with using economic theory to making predictions about human behavior and then using those predictions to justify policy is that the predictions are wrong and the policy justified by them ends up hurting the citizenry.

> People have to be compelled to work; if the poor are to be given relief so they don’t actually starve, it has to be delivered in the most humiliating and onerous ways possible, because otherwise they would become dependent and have no incentive to find proper jobs. The underlying assumption is that if humans are offered the option to be parasites, of course they’ll take it. In fact, almost every bit of available evidence indicates that this is not the case.

The policy justified by homo oeconomicus contributes to a system that prioritizes meaningless, useless, and wasteful employment over universal basic income. Bill Hicks satirizes this state of affairs in one of his comedy routines.

> Boss: _How come you’re not working?_ Worker: _There’s nothing to do._ Boss: _Well, you’re supposed to pretend like you’re working._ Worker: _Hey, I got a better idea. Why don’t you pretend like I’m working? You get paid more than me._

Forcing a person to pretend to work is an act of asserting complete dominion over him.

> Working serves a purpose, or is meant to do so. Being forced to pretend to work just for the sake of working is an indignity, since the demand is perceived—rightly—as the pure exercise of power for its own sake. If make-believe play is the purest expression of human freedom, make-believe work imposed by others is the purest expression of lack of freedom. It’s not entirely surprising, then, that the first historical evidence we have for the notion that certain categories of people really ought to be working at all times, even if there’s nothing to do, and that work needs to be made up to fill their time, even if there’s nothing that really needs doing, refers to people who are not free: prisoners and slaves.

Not only is the slave, prisoner, or modern-day office dweller not free to do what he pleases, but the work his master demands of him isn't even necessary. He is worked for the sake of being worked.

> Freedom is our ability to make things up just for the sake of being able to do so.

The desire to be productive is related to the desire to make art. Both are expressions of one's freedom.

> The desire to create art is simply a manifestation of the urge to play as the exercise of freedom for its own sake.

Nouri notes that what permeates modern-day workplaces is the opposite of the spirit of artistic expression.

> Workplaces are fascist. They’re cults designed to eat your life.

The modern-day office worker, much like a shave, is made to toil at a bullshit job to keep him from rising up against the aristocracy.

> How did we get to the situation we see today, where it’s considered perfectly natural for free citizens of democratic countries to rent themselves out in this way, or for a boss to become indignant if employees are not working every moment of “his” time?

Psychotherapists tell us to listen to our inner voice when judging whether we are making a right decision. This is yet another argument against the system set up by blindly following homo oeconomicus. Employees toiling at pointless jobs feel no remorse for reclaiming the time they supposedly owe to their employer. The author lets one of them speak for this class of enlightened bullshit worker.

> This was psychologically exhausting and it left me depressed, having to go every workday to a job that I considered pointless. Gradually I started losing interest in my work, and started watching films and reading novels to fill the empty shifts. I now even leave my workplace for hours almost each shift without anyone noticing.

The author notes that this person's inner voice didn't stop him from sticking it to the man because of course it didn't.

> Why couldn’t he see it, then, as stealing back time that he’d sold to the corporation? Why did the pretense and lack of purpose grind him down?

## Could a modern-day employer get away with treating his office workers like slaves?

He already does, in a sense. Many office workers feel like slaves while they're on the clock because for that period of time, they don't belong to themselves. Their masters are given legal cover for perpetuating this dynamic.

> One can find occasional warnings by nineteenth-century plantation owners in the American South or the Caribbean that it’s better to keep slaves busy even at made-up tasks than to allow them to idle about in the off-season; the reason given always being that if slaves were left with time on their hands, they were likely to start plotting to flee or revolt. The modern morality of “You’re on my time; I’m not paying you to lounge around” is very different. It is the indignity of a man who feels he’s being robbed. A worker’s time is not his own; it belongs to the person who bought it. Insofar as an employee is not working, she is stealing something for which the employer paid good money (or, anyway, has promised to pay good money for at the end of the week). By this moral logic, it’s not that idleness is dangerous. Idleness is theft.

If the worker disobeys his master, he will be prosecuted like a common thief. Prosecuting one for disobeying the master directly is no longer considered socially acceptable, even though the result of the wage law produces much the same effect. As we have forgotten the perils of slavery, it's started to creep back into our society.

> To be a slave, to be forced to surrender one’s free will and become the mere instrument of another, even temporarily, was considered the most degrading thing that could possibly befall a human being.

Many, especially those with religious proclivities, have tried to paint the idea of owning another human being's time as a thing to admire, not decry.

> Dutiful submission even to meaningless work under another’s authority is a form of moral self-discipline that makes you a better person.

The author calls bullshit on such arguments.

> This element just adds an even more exasperating layer to the perverse morality whereby idleness is a theft of someone else’s time.

## Is becoming a civil servant, a government employee, an act of volunteering yourself to be made into a slave?

No, if you work for elected government, you work for the collective. You are beholden to no one who asserted his dominion over you. Instead, you answer to the people the government works for, people like you.

> Free citizens in democracies were often willing to hire themselves out to the government for public works: but this is because the government being seen as a collective of which the citizen was a member, it was essentially seen as working for oneself.

## How important is social interaction for a human being? 

It is crucial. Without social interaction, a human being gets physically sick (e.g., suffers brain damage).

> Placing prisoners in solitary confinement for more than six months at a stretch inevitably results in physically observable forms of brain damage. Human beings are not just social animals; they are so intrinsically social that if they are cut off from relations with other humans, they begin to decay physically.

## Why do we procrastinate? 

Because this is the most natural way of getting work done when one is free to do with his time what he pleases.

> The traditional student’s pattern of lackadaisical study leading up to intense cramming before exams and then slacking off again—I like to refer to it as “punctuated hysteria”—is typical of how human beings have always tended to go about necessary tasks if no one forces them to act otherwise.

Perhaps this is smart. We can only respond to crises when they happen, not before. We don't work toward protective measures to prevent crises unless we are made to do so. But there will always be crises, so addressing them in advance might be a waste of time. Why spend your life in an anticipation of a crisis when you can just enjoy it, and handle the crisis if and when it occurs?

## Why did people place human skulls on desks in their studies? 

As memento mori.

> To remind themselves that they should make good use of their time because each chime of the clock brought them one hour closer to death.

Carpe diem.
