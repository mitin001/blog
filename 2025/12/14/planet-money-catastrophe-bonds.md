This episode of [Planet Money](../../../2025/10/23/planet-money.md) defined cat bonds.

## What is a catastrophe bond?

It's a special bond sold by a government (e.g., of Jamaica) to investors where paying investors their dividends is a kind of insurance against being left with no funds in case a natural disaster strikes.

> We bet we're going to have a pretty big hurricane in the next couple of years. You want to take the other side of that bet? Basically, if there's no hurricane, you investors get your money back and more. But if there is a hurricane, a big enough hurricane, the Jamaican government gets to keep your money and use it to pay for rebuilding.

Karen Clark has created predictive models that allow investors to assess the expected utility of the cat bonds to determine if they can afford to cover the risk of losing money as a price for a chance to win big.

> So with cat bonds, the investors are taking on a major risk. They could lose all their money with one big catastrophe. This is where Karen's models come in. Her models made this market for cat bonds possible, because they could show investors exactly what risks they were taking on.

The bond market has welcomed cat bonds because it welcomes all kinds of bonds. Smart investors diversify their investments; they want to be able to invest in a wide variety of things.

> Don't put all your eggs into one basket.

The more out there your bonds are the better. The oddities raise the degree of diversification of your investment portfolio.

> Maybe instead of having all chicken eggs, you have one ostrich egg, and it ends up being harder and not breaking in the event that the basket falls.

The standard diversification strategy is to invest sparsely into the whole economy.

> For some people, diversification might mean, OK, instead of putting all of our savings into Apple stock, maybe we'll buy some IBM stock or McDonald's stock. Maybe we'll buy a little piece of every company in the S&P 500.

This way, the winning stocks will cover the losing ones.

> Well, what if there's a recession? All those stocks might go down all at the same time.

If the whole economy tanks with all the stocks falling at the same time, then you might still have a chance to recoup the losses from your alternative investments.

> A really good alternative investment is something that is so unrelated to the rest of the economy, where even if the entire stock market crashes, at least your alternative investments are doing OK.

Another attractive feature of a cat bond is that if you lose money on them, it will be bittersweet. Your money will go to a good cause.

> Will go toward rebuilding people's homes. Cat bonds actually have this kind of do-goodery reputation in the finance world.
