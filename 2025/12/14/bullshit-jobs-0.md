# Preface: On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs

This chapter of [Bullshit Jobs](../../../2025/12/13/bullshit-jobs.md) answered five questions about aberrations that have overtaken the job market, economic paradoxes seemingly everywhere we turn.

## Are we working more despite the automation because of a massive increase in our desire for consumer goods? 

No, but it is a seductive argument.

> Given the choice between less hours and more toys and pleasures, we’ve collectively chosen the latter. This presents a nice morality tale, but even a moment’s reflection shows it can’t really be true. Yes, we have witnessed the creation of an endless variety of new jobs and industries since the twenties, but very few have anything to do with the production and distribution of sushi, iPhones, or fancy sneakers.

The luxury goods (not to mention the basic necessities) can be produced with much less labor now, but there must be more of them being made since people have been working so much more and consuming so much more, right? Wrong. The number of jobs producing those goods hasn't increased.

> Productive jobs have, just as predicted, been largely automated away. (Even if you count industrial workers globally, including the toiling masses in India and China, such workers are still not nearly so large a percentage of the world population as they used to be.) But rather than allowing a massive reduction of working hours to free the world’s population to pursue their own projects, pleasures, visions, and ideas, we have seen the ballooning not even so much of the “service” sector as of the administrative sector.

Here, the author alludes to the prediction from 1930, when it was foretold that a massive increase in leisure time was just on the horizon.

> John Maynard Keynes predicted that, by century’s end, technology would have advanced sufficiently that countries like Great Britain or the United States would have achieved a fifteen-hour work week. There’s every reason to believe he was right. In technological terms, we are quite capable of this. And yet it didn’t happen. Instead, technology has been marshaled, if anything, to figure out ways to make us all work more. In order to achieve this, jobs have had to be created that are, effectively, pointless.

As we know, this didn't happen. Having too much leisure time is taboo in our society, so when we had the chance to seize upon it thanks to the technological innovations of the past century, we instead just made up some busy work for ourselves. It led to a complicated web of multilevel management, clever innovations in the field of looking busy, and outsourcing of the activities of daily living to other people so we can focus on looking busy away from home.

> All those people whose job is to provide administrative, technical, or security support for these industries, or, for that matter, the whole host of ancillary industries (dog washers, all-night pizza deliverymen) that only exist because everyone else is spending so much of their time working in all the other ones.

This is one of those rare instances where a conspiracy theory accurately describes reality.

> It’s as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs for the sake of keeping us all working.

## Why do greedy corporations not get rid of the bullshitters leeching off them?

Because the pretense of job creation gives them enough of the government subsidies and goodwill to pay for the leeches. Because the upper management thinks up _roles_ and not the responsibilities that come with those roles. Because it is an open secret that the higher up the chain of command you go in a corporation the more acceptable it becomes to hold a job without doing a job.

> According to economic theory, at least, the last thing a profit-seeking firm is going to do is shell out money to workers they don’t really need to employ. Still, somehow, it happens. While corporations may engage in ruthless downsizing, the layoffs and speed-ups invariably fall on that class of people who are actually making, moving, fixing, and maintaining things. Through some strange alchemy no one can quite explain, the number of salaried paper pushers ultimately seems to expand, and more and more employees find themselves—not unlike Soviet workers, actually—working forty- or even fifty-hour weeks on paper but effectively working fifteen hours just as Keynes predicted, since the rest of their time is spent organizing or attending motivational seminars, updating their Facebook profiles, or downloading TV box sets. The answer clearly isn’t economic: it’s moral and political. The ruling class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger. (Think of what started to happen when this even began to be approximated in the sixties.) And, on the other hand, the feeling that work is a moral value in itself, and that anyone not willing to submit themselves to some kind of intense work discipline for most of their waking hours deserves nothing, is extraordinarily convenient for them.

The people in charge of corporations are bullshitters themselves, and so they set the objectives of their companies in their image: since they are in power, there must be something to bullshit, so their strategy is to maximize it across every level of management. If the rules of society don't make sense to you, it means that you're not in the 1 percent of the population setting those rules.

> What does it say about our society that it seems to generate an extremely limited demand for talented poet-musicians but an apparently infinite demand for specialists in corporate law? (Answer: If 1 percent of the population controls most of the disposable wealth, what we call “the market” reflects what they think is useful or important, not anybody else.)

Pay reflects this attitude.

> In our society, there seems to be a general rule that, the more obviously one’s work benefits other people, the less one is likely to be paid for it.

Deep down bullshitters can sense that the counterfeit nature of their product (the bullshit) makes it undesirable, and yet they get paid handsomely for it. They rationalize it to mean that they get compensated for the toll it takes on their mental health to be constantly silencing their human desire to be of value to others. So, when bullshitters get entrusted with setting the salaries for others, they divide the spoils secured by the productive class of their underlings in such a way that overwhelmingly favors... other bullshitters. The productive ones have made them all the money, but they also got the satisfaction of being productive, so they don't carry a hole around in their hearts that needs to be stuffed with money, the bullshitters would probably argue.

> But you get to teach children! Or make cars! You get to have real jobs! And on top of that, you have the nerve to also expect middle-class pensions and health care?

When we see human suffering, it's convenient for us to rationalize that the sufferer chooses to suffer and derives some sort of masochistic pleasure from it. If that's what we tell ourselves, then we feel no obligation to help them. Bullshitters like this position so much that they use it to justify the fairness of their pay against the much lesser pay of the people who actually earned their company the money. The ones doing the work must have put themselves in that situation because they like to suffer, so why should they also get money on top of the reward they've already gotten (the suffering)?

> Real, productive workers are relentlessly squeezed and exploited. The remainder are divided between a terrorized stratum of the universally reviled unemployed and a larger stratum who are basically paid to do nothing, in positions designed to make them identify with the perspectives and sensibilities of the ruling class (managers, administrators, etc.)—and particularly its financial avatars—but, at the same time, foster a simmering resentment against anyone whose work has clear and undeniable social value.

The rich and powerful want bullshit jobs to exist because if they were a nuisance to them, they would find a way to rid the world of them just as they found a way to rid large investment banks of the financial troubles they found themselves in after the mortgage crisis.

> Economic trends happen for all sorts of reasons, but if they cause problems for the rich and powerful, those rich and powerful people will pressure institutions to step in and do something about the matter. This is why after the financial crisis of 2008–09, large investment banks were bailed out but ordinary mortgage holders weren’t. The proliferation of bullshit jobs, as we’ll see, happened for a variety of reasons. The real question I was asking is why no one intervened (“conspired,” if you like) to do something about the matter.

The system we have now where useful work is undervalued and most people are kept occupied by pushing papers and the like benefits the rich and powerful. People are too busy to challenge the system, even as they're busy doing nothing.

> There is something very wrong with what we have made ourselves. We have become a civilization based on work—not even “productive work” but work as an end and meaning in itself. We have come to believe that men and women who do not work harder than they wish at jobs they do not particularly enjoy are bad people unworthy of love, care, or assistance from their communities. It is as if we have collectively acquiesced to our own enslavement. The main political reaction to our awareness that half the time we are engaged in utterly meaningless or even counterproductive activities—usually under the orders of a person we dislike—is to rankle with resentment over the fact there might be others out there who are not in the same trap. As a result, hatred, resentment, and suspicion have become the glue that holds society together. This is a disastrous state of affairs. I wish it to end.

## How to test whether a given job is a bullshit job? 

To find out if you're in a bullshit job, just imagine the world of your job were to disappear.

> What would happen were this entire class of people to simply disappear? Say what you like about nurses, garbage collectors, or mechanics, it’s obvious that were they to vanish in a puff of smoke, the results would be immediate and catastrophic.

If it benefits people, it's not a bullshit job.

> It’s not entirely clear how humanity would suffer were all private equity CEOs, lobbyists, PR researchers, actuaries, telemarketers, bailiffs, or legal consultants to similarly vanish.

## What made David Graeber's thesis on bullshit jobs so popular?

When he published his article on bullshit jobs, people occupying those jobs began circulating it among their co-workers. What has been bothering them for years at the back of their minds finally had a name. It became a subject of serious academic research in applied anthropology.

> I got a message from one anonymous fan who said that he was part of an impromptu group circulating the piece within the financial services community; he’d received five emails containing the essay just that day (certainly one sign that many in financial services don’t have much to do). None of this answered the question of how many people really felt that way about their jobs—as opposed to, say, passing on the piece as a way to drop subtle hints to others.

## Why do people argue that a given problem will be solved by the free market despite all the evidence to the contrary?

Because it's a convenient argument to throw out to get people to ignore the problem and let the ones arguing it to continue to pursue their political agenda.

> Whenever you find someone doing something in the name of economic efficiency that seems completely economically irrational (like, say, paying people good money to do nothing all day), one had best start by asking, as the ancient Romans did, “Qui bono?”—“Who benefits?”—and how.

The people who point to the free market as a cure-all when confronted with an economic problem are the Republicans.

> The neoliberal (“free market”) ideology that had dominated the world since the days of Thatcher and Reagan was really the opposite of what it claimed to be; it was really a political project dressed up as an economic one.

If you ask a Republican (an intelligent one) why there are so many bullshit jobs and what to do about them, they will likely tell you that there are no bullshit jobs because the free market wouldn't allow for their existence. If a company would save money from multiple administrative positions getting consolidated into one, then they would follow that incentive and do that. The fact that they're not doing that is sufficient evidence to conclude that we've reached a perfect equilibrium of capitalism wherein all jobs are necessary, a Republican would argue. Of course, you don't have to walk too far into any office to see with your own eyes that this isn't the case, but this argument can be explicated at length to filibuster any evidence of the contrary. As they play their games of stalling debates in the open, behind closed doors the Republicans quietly pursue their political agenda.

> The combination of globalization, gutting the power of unions, and creating an insecure and overworked workforce—along with aggressively paying lip service to sixties calls to hedonistic personal liberation (what came to be known as “lifestyle liberalism, fiscal conservativism”)—had the effect of simultaneously shifting more and more wealth and power to the wealthy and almost completely destroying the basis for organized challenges to their power. It might not have worked very well economically, but politically it worked like a dream.

The rich and powerful want most people distracted by bullshit jobs, and so the Republicans use all of their old tricks to guard this status quo for their benefit. To ingratiate yourself with the people that have piles of money is to increase the likelihood they'll let you stand next to those piles. Clever people they are, those Republicans.
