# [Lady Gaga Announces Her Highly Anticipated Seventh Studio Album](https://www.universalmusic.ca/press-releases/lady-gaga-announces-her-highly-anticipated-seventh-studio-album-mayhem-due-march-7/)

I keep seeing [Lady Gaga](../../../2025/12/09/rollingstone-lady-gaga-mayhem-tour-grammys-cover-story-interview.md)'s quotes from this press release shared by her fans on Twitter, so I decided to properly revisit the original press release. It answered a question about the artwork for the album it announced.

## Why do the album covers for Lady Gaga's _Mayhem_ show pieces of a broken mirror?

It's not just a broken mirror, it's images of someone (her) deliberately reassembling it, Lady Gaga explains.

> Even if you can’t put the pieces back together perfectly, you can create something beautiful and whole in its own new way.

This is a metaphor for the album. It is a reconstruction of music from Lady Gaga's earliest albums. They shattered as she was getting overworked and subjected to experiences that left her with psychological trauma. Now that she's in recovery, she's trying to put the pieces back together, and _Mayhem_ is her attempt at that.
