# [How Lady Gaga Found Herself Again](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lady-gaga-mayhem-tour-grammys-cover-story-interview-1235460150/)

Google recommend this article to me in its Android news feed because I'm a fan of Lady Gaga. The article answered four questions about her.

## What is Lady Gaga's Mayhem Ball concert, _The Art of Personal Chaos_, really about? 

She explains that the show tells the story of her inner demons torturing her.

> “Mayhem is how I start the show,” she says. “It’s the most egocentric side of me, a side of being Gaga that I really loathe. I basically announce that I’m the queen, and I put a more naive and youthful version of myself into a deep sleep — with a desire to torture her, as a way of teaching her how to be great. Ethereal Gaga enjoys it. She just falls into this gothic mania, and Mayhem is aghast because her whole motivation was to teach this girl a lesson and sort of abuse her into greatness. And what she wanted doesn’t go as planned.”

Stefani Germanotta created Lady Gaga to own up to the fame, to show the world (and herself) that she's worthy of it. Unfortunately, she's managed to only show that it was Lady Gaga, not Stefani, who was deemed worthy of fame. Stefani lost herself in Lady Gaga, who is nothing like Stefani. Lady Gaga is a narcissist. She announces herself as the queen and commands others to bow to her. Stefani is buried deep inside Lady Gaga, and Lady Gaga's sole purpose is to show Stefani her worth, but her way of doing that is through torturing Stefani. Somewhere along the way, Stefani completely lost herself in Lady Gaga. This all sounds like a dramatic scene in one's artistic exploration of oneself, but this was Stefani's real lived experience. Playing the Lady Gaga persona has led to her experiencing psychotic episodes. Stefani's mental health had some very low lows. She's overcome them and is now using allegories in her concert to tell us what's she's gone through. Much of the struggles in Stefani's mental health come from perfectionism, in pushing herself too hard to try to attain the unattainable through her artistic expression.

> “I think maybe people don’t know how heavily I was worked as a young person,” says Gaga, and I remind her of the time I watched her perform six songs after midnight for some random promotional video in 2009. Her voice gave out, and she fled the room, only to return and force herself through the inconsequential performance with a level of inhuman determination I found worrisome. Like her character, she had a habit of embracing the pain inflicted upon her. “I believed in suffering for your art.”

_Disease_ is the first song on the album _Mayhem_. It sets the stage for this story, Gaga explains.

> That song is so deliberately about somebody that wants to harm you — and it being you.

Every one of our demons is a manifestation of what went wrong with us at some point in our lives. It is within us to fix them.

> The “Disease” video reaches a new height of horror toward the end, when Mayhem, masked and in bondage gear, retches up a large quantity of black bile. Shortly afterward, the scenario shifts, and Ethereal Gaga wraps her foe in an embrace, singing the chorus to the monster: “I can cure your disease.”

## How does Lady Gaga react to criticism of her work?

She puts on even more extreme and controversial performances. She created the horror-themed _Disease_ video in response to the criticism for the movie _Joker 2_, where she was a lead. She had Millie Brown vomit on her in the performance of _Swine_ for SXSW in response to the criticism her album _ARTPOP_ received earlier that year.

> The stunt helped cement a perception that Gaga was allowing her penchant for spectacle, and what detractors assumed was a desire to shock, overwhelm her music. She tried to explain that the song (“You’re just a pig in a human body”) and performance were an attempt to process her sexual assault, and anything but a random provocation. No one seemed to be listening.

## Why did Lady Gaga take a break from making pop music?

Because the gatekeepers of the industry wanted her to turn her biggest hit into a formula and follow it. Their use for her was finding them a proven way to grow profits.

> I’m going to not make pop music the way that you want me to make it. ’Cause you want everything to sound like “Bad Romance,” and I’m never doing that again.’

The objective of the industry was finding a formulaic approach to music to increase in quarterly profits, whereas Gaga's objective was to explore her artistic vision.

> The world was treating her like a product, not an artist. “It was every angle in every room of every place I went,” she says. “Pro­duct, object, business. ‘What can you get her to do? Will she do this? Can you get her to do this?’ Once I became a huge business for people, their priority was not making sure that I had a dignified artistic experience. It was to make sure that I could earn money as fast as possible.”

Gaga reports that women have much less leeway in the pop industry to dictate the direction of their art than men do.

> When male artists refuse to repeat themselves, she points out, they’re celebrated as visionaries, “radical thinkers discovering new territory,” who don’t “need to adhere to the laurels of their previous success.” Instead, “I was sort of heralded as, like, over.”

So, Gaga found some men that helped her take charge of her artistic direction.

> So she simply slipped out of that world, gliding into “ancillary departments,” with some initial help from the likes of Tony Bennett and Bradley Cooper.

There was some trial and error along the way, but in the end she accomplished the improbable: Gaga now makes the music that she wants to make, on her own terms.

> I kept creating spaces where I could be in control. ‘Maybe if I do this, I won’t be an object.’

## What does Lady Gaga think of _Chromatica_?

Gaga wasn't connected to her art at the time.

> This is somebody that feels very far away from what they’re supposed to be doing.

_Chromatica_ wasn't truthful. Gaga was trying to create music about light when she was in a dark place.

> The spirit of _Chromatica_ was to be hopeful when you’re not.

It was useful in helping her lift herself out of the dark place, but the work that resulted didn't have it.

> A sort of half-measure, a transitional moment.

_Chromatica_ didn't capture the truth that's required to make others relate to the art strongly.

> An album purportedly about healing. She was actually in rough shape.

She had to bullshit through the press tour for the album.

> She was about to do _Chro­matica_ interviews explaining what a great place she was in, but in reality, “I was as great as I could be for someone that smoked weed all day, knocked back a couple bottles of wine, and passed out.”
