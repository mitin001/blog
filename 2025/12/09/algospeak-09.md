This chapter of [Algospeak](../../../2025/11/20/algospeak.md) answered four questions about the dumb directions the algorithm (the sole priority of which is the maximization of our tech companies' shareholder value) is taking us.

## Why do people resist new slang or new technology? 

Every cycle of diffusion of innovation has laggards. They resist the adoption of the new things and hold on to the old things because they tie themselves to them. They fear that if they let go of the old things, they won't be able to learn the new things and so they will be thrown out by society with those old things.

> People typically get upset when the language they grew up with evolves, either because the concept of a “standard language” was ingrained in their education or because new words make them defensively aware of their own obsolescence.

People tie themselves to things because they've invested far too much time in them when they were younger. The lesson here is: don't invest too much time into any one thing. There will always be a new thing to obsess over (or roll your eyes at).

> Kids always develop slang to build identity. Having their own language gives them a sense of community that they can’t have with adults, but because the adults are excluded, they always criticize those kids for “corrupting” the English language. Eventually, the kids grow up, their language is normalized, and the cycle continues on mercilessly.

## What is _skibidi_?

A cartoon character like Scooby-Doo (not a dog though). The name doesn't allude to anything. It's just a nonsense sound someone once made, and others started repeating it.

> It’s etymologically no different from the name Scooby-Doo: Both were nonsense words created from scat singing that were later reapplied to fictional cartoon characters.

## What is Flanderization?

Something television writers worry about in relation to the characters they put in the screen.

> Accidentally simplifying their characters through the exaggeration of certain personality quirks. The eponymous example is Ned Flanders from The Simpsons, who slowly evolves from a well-meaning religious neighbor to a Christian fundamentalist throughout the course of the series. Over time, the commercially popular aspects of the character were enhanced to appeal to the show’s fan base, but it actually worked against the show by making Ned Flanders feel shallower.

There's a paradox in chasing popular trends: it may pay off because you're giving your audience what they seem to want, but it may also ruin your show as the audience sees your cheap attempt at pandering to them for what it is as they see through your intentionally dumbed-down characters. Sometimes the characters are the personae we put on for others. We are in constant danger of Flanderizing ourselves for others' entertainment.

> Creators regularly caricature themselves for the sake of more views, because we have to stay relevant. I’ve watched many a TikTok series where an influencer plays a funny persona, but then hyperbolizes that persona as they try to optimize for more engagement or to maintain interest. I’ve even felt a dissonance over doing this with my own online presence: My “Etymology Nerd” brand started out as me talking about words I like, but eventually evolved into a caricature of my passion for linguistics. I still like what I’m talking about, but I deliver it in a manic, excited style that I know people will prefer to watch.

Here the author confesses that he has Flanderized himself for the views.

> I’m perpetuating simplistic stereotypes, and I see many other writers and influencers do the same for clicks.

He's capitalizing on gotcha trends and simplistic labels that would have no place in serious discourse on etymological studies without significant reservations.

> I’ve written op-eds about the linguistics behind “Gen Z emojis,” and I’ve used generational labels.

By Flanderizing ourselves for the clicks, we collectively Flanderize our community.

> Since an over-the-top exaggerated video of a “tradwife” living a hyper-cottagecore lifestyle is going to perform better than a tangentially cottagecore video, that will inform our idea of what “cottagecore” really means. Then, when people consume and identify with cottagecore content, they identify closer with the extreme idea that was presented to them. Even if a creator isn’t intentionally exaggerating their videos, we know that social media will still amplify more extreme perspectives by virtue of their attention-grabbing ability, inadvertently normalizing those perspectives in our subcultures. The danger, of course, is that we consign our own identities to extreme versions of themselves.

The world is becoming extreme because we're constantly one-upping one another to feed the algorithm.

> We’ve always acquired new behaviors by mimicking the actions of others, but algorithms bring us content representing the most extreme behaviors of others. Again, this leads to us thinking that the extreme is more normal than it is.

## Is the role of the algorithm in shaping our identities overblown?

No, the algorithm is indeed consequential to shaping our identities, and that's because we only understand things through framing. The algorithm is a frame through which we make sense of ourselves and the world around us. When there are no categories to which we can ascribe what we see, everything becomes noise.

> We crave identifiable patterns over random noise. What we choose to categorize is, of course, a reflection of our technological and cultural environment. When everybody was walking around in togas and tunics, there was no need to distinguish goths and punks, but now that fashion and social media have created more options, we can even distinguish between pastel goths and vampire goths. While the idea of “generations” didn’t make much sense in the past, our increased connectivity made the categories more useful, even if they are simplistic generalizations.

The algorithm creates categories to sell us things we often don't need thereby making a profit for the social media platforms that enable these transactions. This algorithm is driven by greed and blind consumerism, but that is the lens through which we've come to understand ourselves in the modern world.
