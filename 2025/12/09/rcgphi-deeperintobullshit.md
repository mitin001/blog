# [Deeper into Bullshit](https://www.rcgphi.com/s/deeperintobullshit.pdf)

This scholarly paper was referenced by [a scholarly article on bullshit](../../../2025/11/16/doi-10.1177-2631787720929704-bullshit.md). It answered four questions concerned with testing whether a given statement or literary work is bullshit.

## Why do some bullshit works of literature survive the test of time? 

Because they were written by people who commanded respect for a reason that was clearly not their expertise on the subject they were writing about. So, people force themselves to engage with their bullshit text.

> Someone struggles for ages with some rebarbative text, manages to find some sense in it, and then reports that sense with enthusiasm, even though it is a banality that could have been expressed in a couple of sentences instead of across the course of the dozens of paragraphs to which the said someone has subjected herself.

Over time, a community forms around the work, and it starts drawing others into it, sometimes for generations.

> Because I was naive enough to believe that writings that were attracting a great deal of respectful, and even reverent, attention could not be loaded with bullshit, I was inclined to put the blame for finding the Althusserians hard entirely on myself. And when I managed to extract what seemed like a reasonable idea from one of their texts, I attributed to it more interest and/or importance (so I later came to see) than it had, partly, no doubt, because I did not want to think that I had been wasting my time.

The author gives the Althusserian school of French Marxism of the 1960s as an example of bullshit literature that has survived the test of time.

> Although I was for a time attracted to Althusserianism, I did not end by succumbing to its intoxication, because I came to see that its reiterated affirmation of the value of conceptual rigor was not matched by conceptual rigor in its intellectual practices.

## How to test whether a statement is bullshit?

Ask the speaker to clarify the statement. If he can't or the clarification bares no resemblance to the original statement, then it was bullshit.

> What particularly interests me is a certain variety of nonsense, namely, that which is found in discourse that is by nature unclarifiable, discourse, that is, that is not only obscure but which cannot be rendered unobscure, where any apparent success in rendering it unobscure creates something that isn’t recognizable as a version of what was said. That is why it is frequently an appropriate response to a charge of bullshit to set about trying to clarify what was said.

If the negation of the statement makes just as much sense as the original statement, then it is bullshit.

> I can offer a sufficient condition of unclarity. It is that adding or subtracting (if it has one) a negation sign from a text makes no difference to its level of plausibility: no force in a statement has been grasped if its putative grasper would react no differently to its negation from how he reacts to the original statement.

## How to test whether a statement is profound?

The same way one tests for whether it is bullshit. If the statement is bullshit, it is not profound.

> Many academics (including perhaps an especially high proportion of graduate students) are disposed to produce the unclarifiable unclarity that is bullshit, not because they are aiming at unclarifiable unclarity, but rather because they are aiming at profundity.

If the statement is not bullshit, it can be clarified. An unprofound statement that seems profound at first quickly loses its profundity upon scrutiny.

> Their clarifiable unclear utterances can be rendered manifestly not profound through clarification. But their unclarifiably unclear utterances are unmanifestly not profound.

## What does it mean for a statement to be suggestive?

It means to be the opposite of articulate. A statement exists on a continuum between articulateness and suggestiveness, explains Fung Yu-lan.

> The more an expression is articulate, the less it is suggestive—just as the more an expression is prosaic, the less it is poetic.
