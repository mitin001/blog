# [The role of bullshit in organisations](https://doi.org/10.3917/mana.165.0653)

This scholarly paper was referenced by [a scholarly article on bullshit](../../../2025/11/16/doi-10.1177-2631787720929704-bullshit.md). It answered five questions about bullshit and its place in the modern corporate world.

## When employees are overwhelmed by the number of meetings they have to attend, what does that tell us about the organization?

That it values bullshit over actual work output. Meetings are a place to bullshit. They benefit only the bullshitters.

> This kind of discourse is particularly prevalent in immaterial contexts that lack a clear sense of social purpose or value. In order to stave off this sense of purposelessness, many organisational members turn to the dark art of bullshit.

If not for meetings, bullshitters would have nothing to do, nothing to justify remaining on the organization's payroll.

> In these contexts, employees try to occupy themselves by engaging in bullshit.

Managers use bullshit to convince other people that they matter, but that's not the full story. First and foremost, they use bullshit to convince themselves of that.

> Liberal doses of bullshit help anxious middle managers to perform a confidence trick on themselves and convince themselves that they are useful and worthwhile members of the organisation who actually have something to add. This can help to firm up their sense of self worth and confidence.

As it's become increasingly permissible to bullshit one's way through school and life and the degree of incompetence has steadily risen in the professional work, talking about work has become as important as doing the work.

> Just doing things is not enough – what is really important is being able to talk in a compelling and convincing way about what will (or perhaps might) be done.

Bullshitters may be incompetent at the job for which they were hired, but they can talk, and they make sure talk is just as valued, if not more, than real work. Highest-paid members of such organizations get paid to think up company visions and mission statements.

> To jumble together a whole set of nice sounding generic words like ‘quality’, ‘service’, ‘value’ and so on with little effect. Indeed, being a middle manager often means becoming adept at working with these ephemeral ‘weasel words’.

To be a manager is to know how to distract people with nonsense so they never notice that you don't do any actual work or even know what's going on in the organization.

> What is so remarkable about this large managerial lexicon is how often it has little relationship with the reality of what is going on in an organisation. Reading a strategy statement in many firms will not reveal what the firm does. Listening to talk in a meeting often reveals little about what happens in employees’ day-to-day work.

Management, i.e., the ability to pretend to work, is a skill you can learn at any school if you bullshit through assignments, or a special management school for an additional layer of bullshit.

> Training in management involves mastering the art of empty talk.

Schools of management produce managers. Schools of other subjects produce experts (or managers, depending on whether the person has been bullshitting through their assignments).

> Bullshit allows individuals to build up an appealing image (often in absence of other more substantive resources such as knowledge and abilities).

Having learned the skill of convincing others of their nonexistent expertise, managers take over the corporate world, filling their calendars with meetings during which they continue blowing hot air for hours at a time, every day. This continues for years, all the way until they hit their retirement age.

> A bullshitter might list a whole string of impressive facts and figures about a consumer market (which are rattled off without concern for whether they are accurate or not) so that they are seen as an expert in this area. Such an act might deceive us (as they may not in fact be an expert) and serve the bullshitter (as it bestows them with an air of expertise).

## How to bullshit effectively?

Believe it or not, bullshitting comes with its own rules, and it requires diligence and experience to master them all.

> At the core of the task of bullshitting seems to be the avoidance of any obvious connections between discourse and truth or reality. This is often a difficult task to achieve as most statements can be pinned down and compared to some criteria in one way or another. The skilled bullshitter seeks to avoid this connection. After all, it would draw them into the requirements of justification and reason-giving – a game they would surely lose at.

Enter the weasel words.

> This entails words or concepts that are difficult or impossible to pin down. Very broad words like ‘excellence’, ‘quality’ and ‘innovation’ are excellent examples of strategic ambiguity. They are words that could mean almost anything to anybody. Using such words makes it difficult for an interlocutor to pin them down and inquire in any more depth into their particular claims. It allows a bullshitter to escape from too much interrogation.

ChatGPT is the ultimate bullshitter. Everything it says is masked with weasel words so the user is led to believe it's not just a random word generator they've been chatting with. It's no wonder ChatGPT powers so much of academic dishonesty. Humans are better at bullshitting than ChatGPT, though, because they can master another rule of bullshitting: constantly throwing new things against the wall so nothing sticks to it, leaving them unaccountable for what they said.

> By keeping discourse shifting and moving, it is possible for the bullshitter to avoid attaching themselves to a particular position which they might be asked deeper questions about. For instance, many corporate strategies are typically made up of a set of rapidly shifting trends, ideas and management fashions. Because the actual content of corporate strategy changes so rapidly, it becomes difficult to subject it to any kind of critical scrutiny. Once questioning and criticism has been formulated, the discourse has moved on. The result is that continued shifting discourses are rarely, if ever, subjected to scrutiny. Instead, they are tolerated as passing amusements and novelties. Bullshitting is hard work. It requires the capacity to continually come up with new, over-packed, ambiguous concepts.

To get a list of weasel words and ideas ripe for creating a dynamic stream of bullshit, managers consult self-proclaimed gurus from the management ideas industry. These are the people most talented in the art of bullshitting. Your middle manager simply repeats what he's overheard from his guru.

> There is a whole industry of consultants, gurus and other managerial idea workers who are charged with creating and circulating these discourses. The management ideas industry works through continually feeding out a series of fads and fashions.

No one said that managers, having gotten this far without learning any useful skill except bullshitting, have learned to bullshit well. Most managers simply recycle the copy printed on colorful pamphlets handed to them at bullshit conferences by better bullshitters. The management ideas industry has an healthy market for its bullshit.

> This gives potential adopters a stock of ideas and discourses that they can use in their day-to-day acts of bullshit mongering.

## Are bullshit meetings harmful to an organization?

Yes, they breed cynicism and resentment among the employees who actually do the core work of the organization.

> People working within bullshit laden organisations not only develop a deep sense of cynicism, but also experience a sense of violation and harm being done to their occupational identity, and often, by implication, to themselves. Many professionals who have been subjected to the discursive vagaries of new public management, for instance, often experience it as being an assault or affront to their identities as skilled and able professionals.

Mired in bullshit, an organization may lose its purpose and yield the market to a competitor with clearer reasons to exist and serve its customers.

## How to deal with bullshit meetings? 

Play bullshit bingo with the non-managers on your team.

> The players are challenged to count up the number of empty buzz words which are used during a meeting. Often they will be assigned a buzz word (like ‘value’, ‘quality’, ‘responsibility’ etc.). When your buzz word is uttered during a meeting, you score a point. The person with the highest score at the end of the meeting wins.

If the managers find out, just tell them that this was a team-building exercise. They don't need to understand the real point of the game.

> It points to the emptiness and disconnection from reality often present in management discourses. It suggests that the vocabulary of management is virtually interchangeable and means very little.

## Why are there so many bullshit jobs?

Because automation has reduced the number of real jobs, so people had to make up bullshit jobs, argues David Graeber.

> The rise of highly productive technologies during the early 20th century – such as factory automation - coupled with the extensive outsourcing of most manufacturing to countries like China has meant that there is less need for labour in Western countries. People need to work less but they seem to do more. It is this, Greaber argues, that has caused the advent of bullshit jobs. Ultimately he sees these empty and meaningless jobs as a way of corralling the surplus time available in Western society into the controlling structure of the work place.

People in power can't just give everyone universal basic income and make work optional because they fear that if people are left to their own devices, they'll rise up against them.
