# [Non-Ionizing Radiation (NIR) Safety Manual](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/EHS_NIR_Safety_Manual.pdf)

This manual was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on non-ionizing radiation](../../../2025/12/01/wikipedia_non-ionizing_radiation.md). It answered five questions about the kind of physics everyone working with MRI magnets or electrical appliances (or even anyone exposed to the sun) should know.

## If liquid helium or nitrogen are not combustible and do not directly promote ignition, why are the rooms where cryogenic liquids are handled always designated as no smoking areas?

Because the containers housing them (Dewars) are so cold that condensation of oxygen, a flammable gas, forms on them.

> While nitrogen and helium do not support combustion, their extreme cold Dewar causes oxygen from the air to condense on the Dewar surfaces, which may increase the oxygen concentration locally.

Release of a cryogenic liquid of a Dewar causes an increase in the concentration of oxygen in the room.

> Liquid helium will condense and solidify any other gas (air) coming into contact with it.

Contact between oxygen and a cryogenic liquid must be kept to a minimum.

> Since liquid nitrogen is colder than liquid oxygen, the oxygen in the air will condense out. If this happens for a period of time, the oxygen concentration in the liquid nitrogen may become so high that it becomes as dangerous as handling liquid oxygen.

## Why must cryogenic liquids be refilled even when they're not used?

No container provides a perfect seal from heat, so the liquid's temperature will inevitably rise, leading to its evaporation and a buildup of pressure, unless whatever portion of the liquid has turned into gas is removed. What gets removed must eventually be refilled.

> Cryogenic liquids, even when kept in insulated storage Dewars, remain at a constant temperature by their respective boiling points and will gradually evaporate. These Dewars must always be allowed to vent, or dangerous pressure buildup will occur.

The removal of the evaporated cryogenic liquid from the Dewar is simple: the gas should simply be allowed to exit the container and travel into the atmosphere.

> The gases are nontoxic and completely harmless if adequate ventilation is provided to avoid suffocation.

Evaporated cryogenic liquid is very cold: if it fills the room, it will lead to a condensation of the oxygen in it. For this reason, it should not be allowed to fill the room. There must be adequate ventilation in any room with a Dewar. Different gases need vents at different places: light gases need vents at the top and heavy gases need vents at the bottom.

> Nitrogen is heavier than the air and starts filling the pit from the bottom during the magnet pre-cool or regular nitrogen fills.

Cryogens are needed to keep the coils within the magnet system from overheating and becoming resistant to current flow. Because cryogens evaporate, they must be occasionally refilled.

> A boil-off of liquid cryogens is expected during the normal operation of the magnet system.

## How to memorize the frequency-wavelength-energy table? 

At 300 Hz, the wavelength is 1000 km. Then, as you multiply the frequency by a factor of 10, divide the wavelength by the same factor of 10. For example, for the microwave near-infrared frequency 300 GHz (300 * 10^9 Hz), the wavelength is 1000/10^9 km = 1/10^6 km = 1/10^3 m = 1 mm.

The photon with the wavelength of 1 mm (one that travels 1 mm in a vacuum before its E-vector completes a full phase) has the energy of 1.2 meV. As you divide the wavelength by a factor of 10, multiply the photon energy by the same factor of 10.

For example, the photon with the wavelength of 100 nm has the energy of 12 eV, the ionization threshold (if a photon with this or higher energy encounters an electron, it will separate it from its atom, unless the atom's ionization energy is higher).

## Is every part of the human body uniformly sensitive to an increase in temperature? 

No, areas of low blood flow are more sensitive to temperature increases (e.g., from exposure to radiofrequency radiation).

> The eyes and the testes are particularly vulnerable to heating by RF because blood circulation in these parts of the body is low and heat, therefore, is not dissipated easily.

The more blood flow an organ gets, the faster it can restore its normal temperature.

## What causes cataracts?

Cataracts are clumps of denatured protein in the lens. The denaturation happens when the lens is exposed to UV light in the 320-368 nm range.

> A glucoside in the lens absorbs strongly below 368 nm, which results in protein denaturing in the lens, browning, and may eventually produce cataracts.
