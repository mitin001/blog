This episode of [Rachel Maddow](../../../2025/11/01/rachel-maddow.md) answered a question about how the Trump administration is going after its political enemies.

## Why are Trump's political enemies suddenly finding themselves probed for mortgage irregularities?

Because apparently the most loyal of Trump's appointees is in charge of the agency that oversees mortgages.

> That case appears to have originated with an obscure little federal agency that handles mortgage financing, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which nobody has ever had to think about ever before. Trump put a very MAGA Trump appointee in charge of that agency. And now in running that agency, he appears to have been using the data, the paperwork that that agency has access to, to essentially try to find crimes to prosecute against Trump's list of enemies. He has tried to do with California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff and his mortgage and with Fed Governor Lisa Cook and her mortgage and also with New York Democratic Attorney General Tish James and her mortgage.

[Bill Pulte](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/watchdog-being-ousted-us-housing-regulator-involved-trump-crackdown-sources-say-2025-11-03/) took it upon himself to abuse his access to the mortgage data on Americans to try and find dirt on Trump's political enemies.

> This Trump appointee who runs this obscure mortgage data agency, who seems to have been the source for all of these weird criminal cases against Trump's political enemies, that guy last week fired the inspector general at that agency.

The reason for Joe Allen's dismissal appears to be that he tried to turn over information that was pertinent to the investigation. It appears that Trump's loyalist Bill Pulte didn't want extra eyes on how he was trying to use the mortgage data to go after the people inconvenient to the Trump administration.

> The inspector general received notice of his termination from the White House after he made efforts to provide key information to prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia.
