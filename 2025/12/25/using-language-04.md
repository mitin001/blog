# 4. Common ground

This chapter of [Using Language](../../../2025/12/14/using-language.md) answered four questions about belonging—to a community or in a relationship with another person.

## What is common ground? 

It's that part of self-awareness that holds assumptions we make about what the other person knows when we are talking to them.

> When my son and I enter a conversation, we presuppose certain common ground, and with each joint action—each utterance, for example—we try to add to it. To do that, we need to keep track of our common ground as it accumulates increment by increment.

Every interaction with another person expands or amends the assumptions of the common ground we share with that person. We could assume we've experienced the same event if we were both present during it, but when we later talk about it, we may discover differences in how we've experienced it.

> Each of us lives in a world of perceptible things, entities we can look at, feel, hear, smell, taste. At any moment, we have perceptual access, with more or less effort, to only part of that world, our perceptual shell. You and I have distinct perceptual shells, but when we are together, they overlap.

## When a gay person says he doesn't consider himself to be a part of the gay community, is he wrong?

It depends on how much common ground he has with the community. One's membership in a cultural community is not an attitude. It is a quantifiable amount of expertise such membership confers. If this amount is greater than that of the general public, then the person is indeed a part of the cultural community that's the source of this information. A cultural community is a collection of people that share significant common ground.

> Its very definition depends on the members’ possession of a common ground.

This definition doesn't allow for personal attitudes. If you know more about gay culture than the general public (from being gay), then you're part of the gay community, even despite your best efforts to disguise the evidence of your membership in this community.

## What is the difference between personal common ground and communal common ground? 

How the shared knowledge is organized: as an encyclopedia vs. a personal diary. The knowledge of communal common ground can be organized like an encyclopedia.

> Facts, beliefs, and assumptions about entire communities.

When you're a member of a community, you have access to the encyclopedia of communal common ground you share with this community. However, the encyclopedia model is insufficient for shared knowledge in the personal common ground.

> It won't represent your or my personal experiences.

Those are better represented in a personal diary. 

> For an entry to be used as the shared basis for common ground, it must represent the diarist, another person, and the entity that they jointly experienced.

Strangers can share a great deal of communal common ground but not personal common ground.

> If communal common ground defines cultural communities, then personal common ground defines friends versus strangers. Ann and Ben may jointly belong to many cultural communities and still be strangers.
They won't be friends or acquaintances until they have a history of joint personal experiences - things done, talked about, or experienced together.

Communal common ground confers expertise in a community whereas personal common ground covers expertise about a person.

> Whereas ophthalmologists are experts in ophthalmology, friends are experts about each other.

## What's the difference between an acquaintance and a friend? 

The amount of personal common ground shared.

p.115

If the person common ground you share with someone is so extensive that it includes private information, you're not just friends but intimates. On the other hand, if all you share is not private common ground but rather communal common ground, you're strangers.

> Personal common ground is information based on personal acquaintance: It is lacking in strangers and greatest for intimates.

Just as the strength of one's membership in a community can be inferred from the extent of their use of the communal lexicon, the strength of one's attachment to another person can be measured by the size of their shared personal lexicon. 

> The larger the lexicon, the greater the solidity of the couple.
