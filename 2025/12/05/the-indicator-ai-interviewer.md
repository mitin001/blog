# [AI is your job interviewer](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5593168)

This episode of _The Indicator_ was referenced by [Planet Money](../../../2025/10/23/planet-money.md). It answered a question about what AI is doing to our society.

## How is AI influencing the way we speak?

We accommodate the AI weirdness into our own speech patterns and tone, and it's not a good thing. When AI speaks to us, it has been programmed to do so in a particularly unsettling tone.

> There's been all this talk about how AI is too sycophantic.

The AI company obsessed with making its product as addictive as possible has made their bot into a milquetoast.

> It's always sucking up.

And now the tables have turned. 

> Now we have to study up on how to suck up to machines.

With AI interviewers, we now have to give a machine much more thought than we otherwise would. We must adapt to the AI if we were to have any hope of being economically secure (employed). We now have to optimize ourselves to the parameters of a machine. With the HR department having gotten outsourced to AI, the job interview has become an exercise in giving the algorithm what it wants with the tone it expects. We have to speak to it in a way it speaks to us.
