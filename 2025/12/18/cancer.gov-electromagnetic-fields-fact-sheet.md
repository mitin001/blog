This FAQ was referenced by [an FAQ on cell phones and cancer](../../../2025/11/27/cancer.gov-cell-phones-fact-sheet.md). It answered three questions about electromagnetic radiation and one question about cancer.

## Where does electromagnetic radiation come from? 

Accelerating electrons. Some chemical reactions are so energetic they produce visible light. This is because as chemical bonds are rearranged, electrons move across molecules, and not with a constant velocity. When electrons accelerate, photon emissions are expected (accurately predicted by quantum mechanics with probability distributions). When there's a difference in potential energy (voltage) across a conductor, electrons begin drifting through it. This acceleration of electrons emits electromagnetic radiation, but of lower energy (lower frequency) than that of higher-energy chemical changes. Once way to achieve a voltage is to connect conducting material from an area of high electron density to an area of low electron density, similar to how putting water into an vertical pipe open at both ends will cause it to flow from an area of higher potential energy due to height and gravity to an area of lower potential energy.

> An electric field is produced by voltage, which is the pressure used to push the electrons through the wire, much like water being pushed through a pipe.

## How much do electronics bombard us with radiofrequency photons?

Accelerating electrons in electronics consistently emit astronomically large numbers of photons, each of which carries negligible energy. If the appliance is said to emit 1 W/m² of radiofrequency radiation at a certain distance from it, that means that every second approximately 10^23-10^27 photons (depending on radiation frequency=energy) pass through a 1 m² square positioned at that distance perpendicularly to the photon emission flow.

> Radiofrequency radiation is measured in watts per meter squared (W/m²).

Each radiofrequency photon carries approximately 10^-27 to 10^-23 J of energy, so to add up to 1 W (1 J/s), it means there are 10^23-10^27 photons passing through the square every second.

## Where is most of the radiofrequency radiation hitting your body coming from? 

Probably cell phone base stations, especially if you live or work near one.

> A study that used using personal portable exposure meters to assess exposures to different sources of radiofrequency EMFs among children in Europe found that the single largest contributor to the total radiofrequency EMF exposure was the proximity to base stations.

## Can men get breast cancer? 

Yes, breast cancer can develop in both women and men, but it is very rare in men. Both women and men have ducts connecting lobules of the breast to the nipple, although men often don't have the lobules (underneath the nipple there are usually just blind ducts extending a short distance into the fat tissue not connected to anything on the other end). The cells lining the milk ducts are much more likely to form tumors than cells of the surrounding tissue.

> The most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma, which begins in the lining of the milk ducts (thin tubes that carry milk from the lobules of the breast to the nipple). Another type of breast cancer is lobular carcinoma, which begins in the lobules (milk glands) of the breast.

Lobular carcinoma is particularly rare in men became breast lobules are rare in men.
