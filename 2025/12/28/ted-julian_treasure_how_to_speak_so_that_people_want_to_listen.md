# [Julian Treasure: How to Speak So That People Want to Listen](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_how_to_speak_so_that_people_want_to_listen/transcript)

This TED talk was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). It defined dogmatism.

## What is dogmatism?

> The confusion of facts with opinions.

Any time someone wants you to believe their opinions rather than facts, they're imposing a dogma on you. Because such people have a reputation for coercing others into adopting their beliefs, dogmatism has a negative connotation. A point of view unencumbered by facts is a dogmatic point of view. When a propagandist accuses a scientist of believing in dogma, all the scientist needs to do is to go over the facts to prove that no portion of a given scientific theory rests on anyone's opinion. Only facts are allowed as evidence in a scientific theory.
