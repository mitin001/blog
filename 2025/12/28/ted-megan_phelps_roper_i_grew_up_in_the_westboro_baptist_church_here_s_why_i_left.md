# [Megan Phelps-Roper: I grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church. Here's why I left](https://www.ted.com/talks/megan_phelps_roper_i_grew_up_in_the_westboro_baptist_church_here_s_why_i_left/transcript)

This TED talk was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). It answered a question about the effect of the cloak of anonymity that comes with online spaces.

## Does the social media make us less civil?

Not everybody. To not let social media have this effect on you, use the properties of this medium to your advantage in cultivating civility.

> People often lament that digital communication makes us less civil, but this is one advantage that online conversations have over in-person ones. We have a buffer of time and space between us and the people whose ideas we find so frustrating. We can use that buffer. Instead of lashing out, we can pause, breathe, change the subject or walk away, and then come back to it when we're ready.

If a social media troll upsets you, walk away. Because the troll is not standing in front of you waiting for your response, there's no pressure to respond right away. Or ever. Or you may turn the conversation around. If you're conversing with someone who trolls others inadvertently (believes in the bile they spew), you may take your time to craft your response with kindness and diplomacy, and such a response may even change the other person's mind and give them the ability to treat others with civility. This happened to the ex-Westboro Baptist Church paritioner/propagandist Megan Phelps-Roper. A Twitter conversation was a turning point in her life: it led to her decision to leave the church and marry the Twitter user.
