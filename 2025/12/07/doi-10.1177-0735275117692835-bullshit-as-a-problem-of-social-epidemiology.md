# [Bullshit as a Problem of Social Epistemology](https://doi.org/10.1177/0735275117692835)

This scholarly paper was referenced by [a scholarly article on bullshit](../../../2025/11/16/doi-10.1177-2631787720929704-bullshit.md). It answered four questions about our culture and the role of bullshit in it.

## Where does bullshit come from? 

Bullshit fills the gap where there's misalignment between the social and epistemological needs. We put up with bullshit because of social norms.

> Tension between the individual pragmatic need to have true beliefs and the social pragmatic need to get along.

Bullshit shows up in places where it is not challenged. Because it's impolite to challenge someone's knowledge in public social contexts, that's where we see the greatest amount of bullshit.

> Being social means turning down and at times turning off one’s epistemic vigilance, at least publicly.

Bullshit pops up where there's disagreement over what is true and what it means to have integrity.

> It reflects those elements of social performance that allow us to get by without a clear standard of truth and honesty.

In social contexts, the quality of the exchanged information may suffer because it is not the point of communication.

> Successful participation in social life often involves not only a fair degree of fakery on our own part but also a willingness to put aside strong epistemic demands on others.

Communication between humans is not an exchange of information, at least not primarily. It is primarily an exchange of attention. Communication has far too many points of failure for robust information exchange.

> The speaker encodes his or her thoughts into language, transmits them through speech, and the listener receives the words and decodes them into thoughts in his or her own mind.

Communication is indexical in nature.

> Our talk often points to things without fully explicating or specifying them.

At every layer of communication there's a degree of approximation.

> People’s phrasing is often vague and ambiguous, relying heavily on the listener’s ability to draw on context to make sense of what the person is saying.

If you're asking someone to inform you while in a social context, don't expect them to pass their knowledge on to you. Expect bullshit.

> Bullshit is a problem of social epistemology—that is, a problem related to the acquisition of knowledge through social sources.

Bullshit results when people exploit vulnerabilities in human communication. 

> Bullshit looks less like a violation of some agreed on or assumed rules of communication and more like a byproduct of flawed communicative machinery.

Bullshit lives outside of the reality where a statement can be either true or false. It lives in muddy waters. It is smoke between mirrors.

> Bullshitter wants to convince the audience that the question of truth or falsity is unimportant.

A bullshitter abuses the trust the hearer is expected to give to the speaker in our society.

> Because mutual relevance and intelligibility typically unfold over the course of the conversation, the listener holds off—and is often expected to hold off—on queries about unspecified and ambiguous phrasings, questionable ideas, and even nonsense, with the hope that the speaker will eventually clarify things. Implicit in this inferential model of communication is the profound sense of trust underly-ing the cooperative dynamics of social interactions.

Bullshit exists because there's a conflict between how easy it is to lie and how valuable the truth is in the world dominated by lies.

> If lying is a fact of social life, then the challenge is not to detect lies but to determine what lies are worth one’s time, energy, and attention. In order for bullshit to exist and proliferate in social life, it has to work some of the time. 
If bullshit—or any other form of deception or misinformation—were not detectable at all, then the very capacity to transmit information socially would be undermined. If bullshit were too easily detectable, then it would not exist, at least as we currently understand it.

Bullshit worms its way into our reality while we're distracted deciding whether it's really worth it to constantly fact-check each other's lies.

> Individuals don’t just need to determine whether someone is speaking truthfully or not, but they have to decide whether it matters in the current context.

If you always call others on their bullshit, the community may ostracize you.

> A skeptical listener threatens the implicit moral order in social interactions, indicating mistrust in what the speaker is saying and implying mendacity or incompetence on the part of the speaker.

And yet, if you and everyone else never call out anyone's bullshit, the world will be overtaken by it.

> The problem is not exercising epistemic vigilance in general. This would be cognitively exhausting and socially alienating in a world where “white lies” are commonplace. Rather, the trick lies in figuring out when and where to exercise epistemic vigilance. Making such judgment points to a source of variation outside of the individual—namely, social context.

Because threading the needle between politeness and truth in the face of bullshit is so tricky, bullshit has started to spread uncontrollably in our society, invading our professional world, sources of information, and even our government.

> The problem is not the “unavoidable” bullshit that is part and parcel of social life but rather the fact that bullshit seems to be expanding into new areas.

Middle managers are bullshitters now. They have no expertise so they want to level the playing field to suit them. As they have nothing to offer in the way of useful information, they want their colleagues to communicate solely for performative reasons. They want their colleagues to play into their incompetence.

> Conclude that we only ever communicate in bullshit. If it’s all bullshit, then com-munication is reduced to mere performance. The only goal is to be more appealing than others.

Other bullshitters are propagandists of harmful ideas. They inject their propaganda into society without it outright detecting what they are doing since their message is obfuscated, couched in bullshit.

> Bullshitters are not indifferent to the truth but that they disingenuously disguise their preference for another truth.

Authoritarians are bullshitters by nature because they want the citizenry to give up on the truth, deem it unknowable, and let the authoritarian dictate to them what they should believe.

## How to get someone to believe a falsehood? 

Baffle them, appeal to the basic things that make them human.

> People’s default cognitive position is gullibility.

Overload their rational mind so much that it shuts down and begins accepting all information as true.

> When the subject’s cognitive capacities became overloaded (in particular, System 2), the subjects were unable to “unbelieve” information that they consciously recognize as false.

The dual-processing view of cognition contrasts System 2 from System 1 in terms of the cognitive effort the brain expends when encountering information. System 2 is more complex and thus more vulnerable to exploitation by bullshitters and propagandists.

> The dual-processing model divides cognition into two basic systems: System 1, or automatic, unconscious cognition, and System 2, or deliberate, conscious cognition.

## What determines whether a given discovery makes it into the scientific record or is even allowed to be made? 

The culture of the scientific discipline or society, not the merits of the discovery alone.

> One cannot judge the credibility of someone’s testimony based purely on the testimony alone. People draw on pieces of information that are external to the claim. Such information indicating credibility—or not—happens within the context of a particular culture that sets standards for trustworthiness and credible social performance. 
Culturally rooted epistemologies also marginalize or discredit certain ideas, topics, and ways of knowing. Those who engage with certain ideas or topics or alternative ways of knowing are potentially suspect from the point of view of another epistemic culture.

If the discovery fits within the cultural context of science in its present day, then it is allowed.

> Rather than “translating” the grant application and their evaluation of it into more generalizable criteria for evaluation, the grant committee members engage in “cognitive contextualization,” placing the application within the intellectual and epistemological context of the field from which they come.

Like any other social institution, science plays by the rules of society, even if its goal is the pursuit of the truth that should be unencumbered by such externalities.

> The gap between the professed universalistic epistemic ideals of science and the socially contingent nature of the actual production of knowledge.

## What is cultural competence?

A culturally competent individual uses factors beyond the content of the message to interpret its meaning.

> Cultural competence means having an array of social frames available to you in order to effectively judge the meaning of a given context.

A social frame is context for the communicated message: language, tone, style, presentation, etc. This is akin to metadata in the digital representation of reality. The same message with a different social frame can have a drastically different meaning.

> A sincere expression of emotion vs. an ironic or sarcastic remark.

A culturally competent individual knows the social frames that make up a given culture and therefore can understand the true meaning of the presented message. The devil is always in the details. Cultural incompetence is an inability to tell whether what someone says is bullshit.

> Believing what a lawyer, politician, or CEO says not only represents a kind of epistemic naïveté but also amounts to a kind of cultural incompetence.

However, if everyone becomes culturally competent, there will still be bullshit. It is one of our basic cultural frames, and it is needed whenever the only way to remain polite is to let our epistemological guard down.

> People often buy into bullshit (perhaps due to some flaw in cognitive processing), but sometimes they recognize bullshit for what is and go along with it anyway.

No culturally competent individual reads letters of recommendation for their content.

> Letter writers and letter readers are both supposed to understand that the writer is not expected to be (and perhaps cannot be) com-pletely forthright. Praise for even middling students or colleagues tends to be inflated. 
High praise could reflect a high opinion or a desire to get rid of an irksome student or colleague. Readers learn to read between the lines of what is said and what is left unsaid in such letters.

The law expects cultural competence from the citizens it protects from false advertising (and doesn't protect from puffery).

> Even though the law generally protects consumers from blatantly false or deceptive claims, it also explicitly expects that culturally competent members of society (i.e., any “reasonable” person) understand over-the-top, unverifiable claims as unproblematic in the context of marketing and advertising.
