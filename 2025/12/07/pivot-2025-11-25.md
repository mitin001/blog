This episode of [Pivot](../../../2025/10/14/pivot.md) answered a question about the new American vulnerability.

## How are foreign actors using the MAGA movement to sow discord in America?

Kara reads a post on Threads that does a good job summarizing how foreign countries exploit the newfound American weakness: the MAGA movement.

MAGA follow and pass around propaganda materials made in overseas troll factories of cyberwarfare, mostly in Russia. Meanwhile, MAGA influencers are making fat profits selling merch to MAGA, merch that was manufactured with the cheapest labor imaginable in the worst sweatshops overseas, mostly in China. Foreign countries are using our greed and freedom of speech against us. This is akin to predators looking for weaknesses among their prey to identify the one they'll have the greatest chance of success with if they were to attack it.

> I love women with tattoos because it shows a history of poor decision-making which plays to my benefit.

America is the new prey of choice for the predatory countries across the world.
