This episode of [On with Kara Swisher](../../../2025/11/02/on-with-kara-swisher.md) answered three questions about resilience, particularly in the face of loss and grief.

## What to do when something upsets you?

Make it into a funny story to share with other people face-to-face or even on stage like Tig Notaro.

> One of the things I discussed on stage was the questionnaire that the hospital sent my mother after she died, asking her how her stay in the hospital went. And when I got that questionnaire, I was so upset. I was so mad. I wanted to make it my life's work to find who sent this and how to stop this. And then after I got back to L.A., I was like, _oh, my God, that is so funny_.

Tig turned a painful reminder of her mother's death into a story funny enough to tell a large audience.

> Part of my stand up for that live album was me answering all of the questions. You know, _was your room too loud?_ Right. _Did your nurses and doctors give you the appropriate care?_ Right.

## What does grief teach you? 

The truth about yourself and your place in the world.

> Grief is the fastest route to truth.

Tig Notaro shares that she discovered her true nature while battling cancer.

> I don't understand who I was even remotely before 2012, before my diagnosis. And that cracked me open in a way that it's sad that a lot of people can't get that awakening until something horrendous happens. But I'm still human and I fall into my old ways of taking things for granted, getting frustrated by the dumbest things. And then I can snap myself out of it in ways when I really get back in touch with what I went through.

Grief teaches us not to be phased by minor inconveniences. It gives us a frame of reference. Compared to what we've been through and survived, daily life's struggles are insignificant.

## Are we here forever, death notwithstanding?

Whatever we leave of ourselves is. Ask Andrea Gibson, who died this year after their battle with cancer. You can't ask them directly, but you can engage with the poem they left behind.

> I am more here than ever before. I am more with you than I ever could have imagined. So close you look past me just wondering where I am.

Don't you feel their presence after engaging with their work? If you respond to it, you're having a dialogue with a person who has died. They can't respond to you with anything more than they've left behind while being here physically, but it shouldn't matter. They're here.
