This episode of _Club Random_, a companion podcast to [Real Time](../../../2025/10/16/real-time.md), answered a question about why we need government.

## How to measure the performance of a government?

Governments fulfill a human need. The government was invented to make individual citizens feel safe.

> As a trade-off for security. That's the primary and first job of government. It is why people gave up rights, gave up sovereignty. It is why serfs worked the land, so that when the barbarians came, they could get behind the castle walls. That was the trade-off.

The primary measure of how good a job a government is doing is, _does it make you feel safe?_

> If they can't do job one, making you feel safe, then they're useless.

Is the Trump administration making us feel safe? Many of us are afraid to go outside in big cities for fear of being harassed by ICE. Trump supporters could say the Biden administration wasn't making them feel safe either because these people were scared of the illegal immigrants roaming the streets supposedly committing crimes with impunity. How much of this fear is manufactured by propagandists, foreign and domestic, remains to be studied, but it is clear that fear for one's safety is one way to inspire the populace to rise up against their government.
