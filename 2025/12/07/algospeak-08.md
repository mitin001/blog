# 8. What Are We Wearing This Summer?

This chapter of [Algospeak](../../../2025/11/20/algospeak.md) answered five questions about the negative effects of capitalism on society, friendships, information, language, and art.

## How has advertising changed in recent years? 

Advertisers no longer market to demographics. They now market to subcultures cultivated by the algorithm. TikTok admits as much on its landing page for businesses.

> Subcultures personalize your approach, resulting in a stronger connection with customers. Your brand becomes part of their identity. TikTokers turn to subcultures to define their online and offline personas, which means they will actively seek out brands they can identify with and align to their true selves.

Marketers try to create or hijack trends like _song of the summer_.

> Pay close attention at the start of June. You’ll suddenly start noticing fashion creators asking the refrain “What are we wearing this summer?” or musicians telling us, “I think I just wrote the song of the summer.” They have to do this. In an increasingly transitory internet landscape, attaching a product to a moment in time lends it a greater salience. You can’t blame them for trying.

In today's increasingly cynical society, social media trends remain among the very few places people entrust with their attention and money.

> By striking when the iron is hot, marketers have a real chance of harnessing a collective label to create an organic-feeling social media phenomenon.

The new approach to marketing is trying every seemingly ridiculous thing they could imagine. Almost everything they try will fail, but if they keep trying they will eventually stumble into one thing that will succeed so spectacularly that it will pay for all the failures.

> It only makes sense for the companies to be doing this because of the “tantalizing possibility of getting it right,” for when it does go right, it goes really right.

Tail events drive today's marketing. It is driven by the everpresent possibility of going viral at any time.

> The creator economy directly feeds into long-tail economics.

But making it to the top will require a lot of work and the fear that it may never pay off. There can only be one song of the summer, one movie of the summer, etc.

> All over social media, 2019 was universally acknowledged as “hot girl summer.” 2023 was “Barbie summer,” and 2024 was “brat summer.”

If you've recorded a song and it started trending as the song of the summer, congratulations, you've won at the attention economy.

> “Hot girl” and “brat” served to advertise new music releases by Megan Thee Stallion and Charli XCX, while “Barbie” advertised a new film release. Labeling these time periods with products turned them into trends, and therefore made them more marketable. Creators play into this pattern because, of course, it pays to hop onto social media trends.

However, be ready to yield the spotlight to the next trend soon.

> This is a double-edged sword: By tying Kamala Harris to a trend, her campaign turned her into yet another fad that became less popular as the summer ended.

Kamala Harris couldn't keep herself at the top of social media trends. By the time the election day came, the masses have long moved on to other trendy things like cheap shirts.

> E-commerce websites like Temu and Shein produce flimsy, unethically sourced products at extremely low cost in response to every social media microtrend.

## Why do social media companies make it easy to spread new words?

For the same reason they do anything: for the money.

> Social media creates new identities in order to commodify them. One can easily forget that these platforms are businesses first, and everything they do is a reflection of their business priorities. If the algorithm spreads new words and identities that build communities, that’s because the platform believes those communities will earn it more money in the end.

Any time you want to know why a company does anything, it's because the people running the company believe it to be making it more money.

> The more ways you can be categorized using specific, newly created microlabels, the more ways you can be commodified.

Spreading new slang of some obscure subculture recruits new people into that subculture, i.e., a new demographic for targeted advertising: _cottagecore_, _pastel goths_, etc.

> Each “goth” categorization and each new “-core” is an emergent effect of algorithmic business priorities intersecting with the human tendency to create in-groups. Each new aesthetic microlabel helps the algorithm know which terms best apply to us, which end up affecting our own aesthetic preferences, which further reinforce the algorithmic labels. Identities are interchangeable with metadata, and metadata is interchangeable with our everyday language.

Of course, the companies don't care about improving our ability to communicate beyond improving it just enough to make us buy things from each other, with the platform taking their cut from every transaction.

> Words are both created and spread because they align with algorithmic priorities.

For this reason, words start to lose their meanings beyond naming something that can be sold.

> Who cares about old definitions when you can use new labels to create new demand?

The word _preppy_ used to describe classic attire worn by kids to private schools for rich people. Now it describes a new genre of clothing that has nothing to do with school uniforms: cartoonishly girly clothing with bright colors, especially pink.

> The owner of cutandcropped didn’t care what baby boomers thought the definition of “preppy” was. She knew her audience (teenage girls), and she knew that this was a trendy word for that demographic. She used the label in her video hook, in her video description, and consistently across her account because she knew it would be recommended to people who had previously shown interest in “preppy clothing.” After capitalizing on the trending word, she made sure to integrate her product into the TikTok shop to make it easier. With enough brands doing this, the definition of “preppy” genuinely changed among younger generations. If you can’t coin a new word, just hijack an old one.

When the author interviewed the owner of a store capitalizing on hijacking the word _preppy_, he noted that to her, words _were_ demographics.

> Over the course of our interview, I couldn’t help but notice that Sophie used the terms “word,” “hashtag,” and “demographic” interchangeably when talking about the concept of “preppy.” Why would she separate them, though? They all represented the same thing.

## Why is Facebook so much worse now?

Facebook has undergone enshittification, a bait-and-switch phase in the evolution of a digital product.

> When I joined the platform, it was a useful, high-quality medium to virtually connect with people I care about. Then it started running more ads, conveniently tied in to Facebook Marketplace. This change was better for sellers, but I had to tolerate it since I now needed the platform to keep in touch with my friends. Finally, once sellers were also dependent on marketing through Facebook, the platform enshittified itself by running more ads and doubling transaction fees—squeezing more revenue out of both users and businesses. It was able to do this by exploiting its sheer dominance in online communication and user data.

The platform promised users connection to their friends, delivered on that promise for a number of years, and now it's time for them to extract their profits from the user base that has become addicted to spying on their friends. They will still get their looking-into-the-peephole fix, but interspersed with ads and irrelevant content hoping to keep them addicted to the platform once all their friends leave.

> Facebook used to show your friends’ content in chronological order, but then reshuffled it to recommend content that aligns with its business priorities. Even though I go on the app exclusively to see updates from my friends, I must now wade through numerous trending meme pages designed to keep my attention; short-form videos clogging my feed; and, of course, an exhausting morass of advertisements.

A company can get away with significantly worsening the user experience if the profits made from the remaining user engagement (whatever of it is left) have been made so great that they justify the inevitable reduction in use due to the enshittification.

> Social media platforms invariably increase profits by decreasing the quality of information being recommended to their audience.

Whereas in the past your friends determined what you saw on your Facebook feed, it's now the job of the algorithm. However, its real job is to train those publishing on Facebook to maximize the company's profits.

> Creators and companies desperately trying to reach their audience in a terminally enshittified environment are constantly striving for ever more metadata to get there, which inadvertently ends up giving the algorithm more numbers to work with.

After replacing content from your friends with viral short-form videos, Facebook went even further and replaced most of the videos with ads. Brands can no longer compete with each other through product placement in the videos. Instead, they buy attention directly from Facebook.

> The more space given to advertisers, the less products can compete on their own, which means the app can charge even higher fees.

## What is spamdexing?

It's when a website had a bunch of hidden text in it that was indexable by a search engine but invisible to the user. As a result, the page would be at the top of a great variety of searches, but the user clicking on a link would be disappointed not to find the content they were looking for once they navigated to the page. In its current form, spamdexing is keyword stuffing.

> The early days of SEO saw a wide variety of “spamdexing” techniques meant to rank websites higher in Google results, such as keyword stuffing, repetition of unrelated phrases, and hidden hyperlinks. Search engines have since gotten smarter, but algorithmic spamdexing lives on. The nine “preppy” hashtags Sophie put in her video speak for themselves, and that comes from a well-meaning small business owner. Everybody’s doing this, because everybody wants to sell you something.

Creators put a list of trendy keywords loosely related to their content under their social media posts and videos.

> People are additionally incentivized to use misleading terms simply because they don’t want to miss out on the SEO. Even though Sophie acknowledges that #maximalist might’ve been a more accurate word to describe her product lines, she chose to use #preppy because she knew it’d perform better online. Hence, more precise vocabulary may be supplanted by whatever happens to be trending.

## Is playing into the trends dictated by the algorithm limiting the artistic expression of our generation?

Yes, algorithmic trends answer the business priorities of social media platforms. They are not the expression of our uniqueness, as true art should be.

> Despite having more options than ever, we may see true individuality flattened in favor of what a select group of others like, because that’s what algorithms do. They don’t recommend content for you; they recommend content based on others similar to you. Nor do you make your own decisions. Your decisions are now curated for you under the guise of personalization, while in reality they’re engineered to make platforms as much money as possible. Your aesthetic preferences, your language, your very identity—all handed down to you by the positive feedback loop of social media algorithms.

If you think this is a strawman argument in the sense that algorithmic selection won't keep great art from being made or seen, consider the fact that we cannot consume art without framing, and the algorithm is the sole frame through which we get to view art in the present day.

> We perceive art in certain categories, and those categories alter our perception of the art. Each aesthetic category comes with a set of “rules” associated with the label, and we judge media based on how it conforms to those rules.

When we play into algorithmic trends, we no longer let our own uniqueness guide us. Instead, everything becomes an assignment. It might not be a bad thing. It might incentivize us to create art where we otherwise wouldn't, had we not a set of algorithmic rules to guide us. A constraint can be a crutch to lean on to keep us from falling. However, true artistic expression doesn't need algorithmic inspiration. It is a screaming voice that aches to leap out of us onto the canvas or the sound board, an end in itself.

> A musician may not make music for the sake of making music, and instead might produce songs that fit into their conceptions of whatever microgenre is trending on Spotify or TikTok.

What a marvel it is to have the whole world connected to one giant art market. What a pity that it is an art market and not an art world.
