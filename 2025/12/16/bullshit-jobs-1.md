# 1. What Is a Bullshit Job?

This chapter of [Bullshit Jobs](../../../2025/12/13/bullshit-jobs.md) answered nine questions about bullshit in our bullshit society.

## What is a bullshit job?

A job that provides no value or job responsibilities and instead demands its holder to devise ways of looking busy.

> A form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.

## What happens when someone holding a bullshit job stops pretending to work?

That's a violation of social norms punishable by steep fines and exposure in the media.

> A court in Cadiz in southern Spain last month ordered Joaquin Garcia, sixty-nine, to pay approximately $30,000 in fines for failing to show up for work at the water board, Agua de Cadiz, where Garcia was employed as an engineer since 1996.

The water board didn't like Garcia's politics and decided to get rid of him without officially terminating his employment. They stopped assigning him work and hoped he would quit on his own out of boredom. Instead, Garcia found a loophole that would keep him on the payroll while he stayed home.

> Rather than just continue to sit around all day pretending to look busy, he would convince the water board he was being supervised by the municipality, and the municipality that he was being supervised by the water board, check in if there was a problem, but otherwise just go home and do something useful with his life.

Even though Garcia held a bullshit job that would provide no value regardless of whether he actively pretended to work or not, refusing to go along with this charade cost him dearly, even as it cost his employer nothing they weren't already prepared to give. Garcia's loophole wasn't even all that notorious. He simply deadlocked the system in the same way banks get away with every day.

> If you complain about getting some bureaucratic run-around from your bank, bank officials are likely to tell you it’s all the fault of government regulations; but if you research where those regulations actually come from, you’ll likely discover that most of them were written by the bank.

Garcia seemed to forget that the bar is lower for regular people. The law doesn't always apply to powerful institutions.

## What is the etymology of the word _bullshit_?

It comes from _bole_, the French word for deceit. The sharp-tongued English speakers just appended _shit_ to it.

> “Bull” is not an abbreviation for “bullshit,” but “bullshit” is an early-twentieth-century elaboration on “bull.” The term is ultimately derived from the French bole, meaning “fraud or deceit.”

The word _bollocks_ is etymologically related to the word _bullshit_. They share a common ancestor.

> “Bollocks” is another derivation from “bole.”

## What are the necessary conditions for the emergence of propaganda?

Powerful people who need apologists for the harm they're doing to society. Propagandists accumulate around powerful people when the actions of such people are harmful and need to be spun as beneficial to keep the society from taking the power away from them to stop the harm. Propagandists are willing to do this job either because it pays well or because they truly believe that the benefits of what they're defending outweigh the harms.

> The more harm a category of powerful people do in the world, the more yes-men and propagandists will tend to accumulate around them, coming up with reasons why they are really doing good—and the more likely it is that at least some of those powerful people will believe them.

## Who is the target audience for propaganda?

Not just the gullible and cynical members of the population. Propagandists themselves must be avid consumers and staunch believers of their propaganda. A propaganist can't remain a propagandist for too long if he's not taken in by his propaganda.

> Often propaganda which is ostensibly aimed at tricking outsiders is really primarily aimed at assuaging the consciences of the propagandists themselves.

## Is money the most important factor in keeping a job?

For many people, but not for everybody. If someone is unfulfilled at their job, they sometimes leave it despite taking a pay cut. At the same time, people could be willing to put up with conditions far worse than shit pay if no other job could give them the same level of fulfillment.

> There’s an old joke about the man whose job it was to clean up elephant dung after the circus. No matter what he did, he couldn’t get the smell off his body. He’d change his clothes, wash his hair, scrub himself endlessly, but he still reeked, and women tended to avoid him. An old friend finally asked him, “Why do you do this to yourself? There are so many other jobs you could do.” The man answered, “What? And give up show business!?”

People have their reasons to find fulfillment in their jobs. Sometimes those reasons overpower the economic incentives to remain unfulfilled.

> I’ve run into a surprising number of people (well, three) with college educations who, frustrated by the pointlessness of the office work available to them, actually did become cleaners simply to feel they were doing an honest day’s work.

## How can there be pretend jobs in firms extracting minute-by-minute efficiency from their workers?

The people pretending to work are the ones imposing draconian efficiency rules on everyone else. Their job consists solely of buying efficiency monitoring software and then pretending to work the rest of the time.

> FedEx and UPS delivery workers have backbreaking schedules designed with “scientific” efficiency. In the upper echelons of those same companies, things are not the same. We can, if we like, trace this back to the key weakness in the managerial cult of efficiency—its Achilles’ heel, if you will. When managers began trying to come up with scientific studies of the most time- and energy-efficient ways to deploy human labor, they never applied those same techniques to themselves—or if they did, the effect appears to have been the opposite of what they intended. As a result, the same period that saw the most ruthless application of speed-ups and downsizing in the blue-collar sector also brought a rapid multiplication of meaningless managerial and administrative posts in almost all large firms. It’s as if businesses were endlessly trimming the fat on the shop floor and using the resulting savings to acquire even more unnecessary workers in the offices upstairs.

## What is the difference between bullshit jobs in Socialist and capitalist regimes? 

Who gets to hold those pretend jobs. In Socialist regimes, blue-color workers were kept from rising up against the regime by the regime keeping them busy looking busy. In capitalist regimes, white-color workers are given bullshit jobs for the same reason.

> Just as Socialist regimes had created millions of dummy proletarian jobs, capitalist regimes somehow ended up presiding over the creation of millions of dummy white-collar jobs instead.

## Is prostitution a bullshit job? 

No, if prostitution were to disappear, it would quickly reappear (evidenced by a swift emergence of the black market of prostitution in societies that make it illegal), thereby signifying an urgent need for this profession's product in our bullshit society. The same cannot be said of bullshit jobs like telemarketing or middle management.

> If telemarketers or useless middle managers were to be made illegal, a black market would be unlikely to emerge to replace them. Obviously, historically this has tended to happen in the case of sex work. This is why one might say the problem is patriarchy itself—the concentration of so much wealth and power in the hands of males who are then kept sexually unfulfilled or taught to seek out certain forms of gratification rather than others—and therefore something much more essential to the nature of society itself.

Our society prefers sex to be transactional.

> This situation shows us to be living in a bullshit society.

Our society incentivizes young women to sell their bodies rather than offer their voices to academic discourse aimed at improving our society.

> Something was terribly, terribly wrong with any society that effectively tells the vast majority of its female population they are worth more dancing on boxes between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five than they will be at any subsequent point in their lives, whatever their talents or accomplishments.

How can we improve our society for women when our society would rather keep women busy selling sex?

> The same woman can make five times as much money stripping as she could teaching as a world-recognized scholar.
