## Does cell phone use increase the risk of cancer? 

No, none of the studies that have found an association between people developing cancer and heavy cell phone use have been definitive. For example, a recent study found a modest increase in the risk for developing a glioma among heavy cell phone users.

> The chance of developing a brain tumor of this type every year is about 3 in 100,000. The researchers concluded that long-term mobile phone use increases this chance to about 9 in 100,000.

If true, this increase would've been detectable in the general population.

> If this group is correct about the size of the effect of cellphones on brain cancer, brain tumor rates should have been dramatically increasing since the introduction of the mobile phone.

But this is not observed in the general population.

> Brain tumor rates are pretty much unchanged since mobile phones arrived. If the Swedish team is right about the size of the cellphone effect, tumor rates would be 40 percent higher than they are. There is virtually no way its results are correct.

Every now and then, another study comes along that asks a cohort of cancer patients or their family members to fill out surveys, notes admissions of heavy cell phone use, and attributes the cancer to that.

> The methodology behind a prospective study is much stronger than that of a case-control study. The latter suffers from recall bias (I have cancer, and I want to blame something, so I over-remember my phone use). This is a particular concern because the data in some of these studies is collected from relatives after the person with cancer is dead. It may be quite difficult (i.e. impossible) for relatives to remember how often someone used a phone in the decade before the illness.

Meanwhile, none of the observational studies have been able to reach the same conclusions.

> The disagreement breaks down along methodological lines. The first camp uses what are called “case-control” studies and usually concludes that there is a link between mobile or cordless phones and tumors. The second camp uses observational studies and generally concludes there is absolutely no relationship.

None of these studies can produce unequivocal results. To definitively answer whether something causes a given disease, we need a randomized controlled trial.

> Take a group of people without mobile phones, give half of them mobile phones, and follow them for 15 to 20 years to see how many of them develop brain tumors. You’d need a huge sample because, as we noted, brain tumors are very uncommon. For a number of reasons — foremost, nearly everyone already has a mobile phone — this isn’t feasible. Usually, our next best option would be a prospective observational study: Take a group of people and collect data on their use of cellphones. Then follow them over time and see who gets brain cancer. The downside of this relative to the randomized trial is that people who use cellphones might be different from those who do not. But this is probably not a major concern here, because brain tumors are pretty random and most people use cellphones. But even this approach is very difficult, because you need an enormous sample size given the rarity of the condition. If you enrolled 50,000 people and followed them for 10 years, you would only expect to see about 20 gliomas. This is far too few to detect differences across groups. And the larger the study, the more expensive and more difficult it is. For this reason, much of the work on cellphones and cancer has used an alternative approach: the case-control study. Here’s how it works: You find a bunch of people with brain tumors (the “cases”). You then find a bunch of people who are similar (in age, sex, etc.) but do not have tumors (the controls). You survey both groups about their behaviors, and you try to identify behaviors that differ across the groups. In this case, researchers look for differences in mobile and cordless phone use.
