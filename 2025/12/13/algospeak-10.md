# 10. Are We Cooked?

This chapter of [Algospeak](../../../2025/11/20/algospeak.md) answered five questions about the evolution of language.

## How does a language optimize itself? 

Through media. The media captures language constructs that are most in favor by the trend-setting segment of the population of its speakers and ensures that they propagate through the wider population. As a result, these constructs become standard and replace the older constructs that have fallen out of favor.

> Music and memes, especially, draw on language as it’s actually spoken; this is because it simply feels more natural. And as media starts trending, the words spread faster.

## How quickly are languages going extinct? 

Now that the Internet has supercharged their extinction, it seems that the half-life of the global linguistic diversity has gotten reduced to a mere century. We're living through a period of reverse Babylon brought on the pressures of the marketplace. Purveyors of the attention economy extract the greatest profits when everyone they target conforms to the same language.

> Even the largest video platform, YouTube, supports only 80 languages, despite there being around 7,000 languages worldwide. This is a problem with the internet in general—Google supports only 240 languages and Wikipedia 345 languages—but the issue is amplified on social media, since it only makes sense for the apps to cater to larger audiences where they can create trends and in-groups. The lack of online resources for languages spoken by smaller populations only contributes to their looming extinction. The consensus is that nearly half of all languages will disappear by the end of the century, with one dying out every other week.

## How much longer will English remain the dominant language? 

It won't yield to any other language any time soon. The Internet is already largely in English, and it only tends to amplify what's already dominant, not bring about radical cultural shifts, which would be needed to establish the dominance of another language.

> There certainly is a heavy Western bias to languages that are available on social media. Even though 7.5 percent of the world’s population speaks Hindi, less than 0.1 percent of all websites are in Hindi, while a language like German punches far above its weight (5.5 percent of the internet compared with about 1 percent of global speakers). This means that any social-media-fueled linguicide will disproportionately impact the culture of already marginalized communities. English, specifically, benefits as the majority language of the internet. It’s the same “preferential attachment” process that makes trending memes even trendier: People will latch onto socially desirable languages, making them more widely used, which then makes them more socially desirable. That’s why, regardless of any geopolitical shifts, we will likely see English continue to determine global linguistic trends for the foreseeable future across cultures.

## Are social media dialects ruining our language?

No, it's the same process as geographically separated settlements forming their own dialects. That hasn't ruined languages (it only enriched them), so there's no reason to think that social media bubbles will unleash some linguistic parasite on the world that will hollow out our ability to communicate.

> Historically, linguists have employed the rule of thumb that “the longer a place is settled, the more dialects will form.” In traditional geographic settings, it meant that individual towns, social groups, and regions will develop their own linguistic quirks to suit their particular needs, but the maxim can also be applied to the internet. As we’re spending more time on social media, we’re forming more and more niche communities, which ultimately give us even more dialects. Some of us are even developing multiple accents as we code-switch between the online and the offline contexts, just as people have code-switched throughout time. Regardless of whether any of that helps big tech companies, we’re playing out a millennia-old human trend.

Language adapts to social needs, not the other way around.

> Accents and dialects are conditioned social responses to those groups, and we will reach a homeostasis of dialectal diversity to match the depth of human diversity.

For example, American Sign Language (ASL) is already adapting to the fact that hand gestures must be made capturable by a phone in its portrait (not landscape) mode, which is what's preferred by social media, the defining trendsetter of our day.

> The word for “dog,” for example, is traditionally made by tapping one hand onto your waist, but that specific gesture doesn’t make as much sense in the age of vertical video, where it would appear off-screen. Instead, social media users have taken to signing the letters DG twice, which also looks as if you were snapping for a dog’s attention. Although this confuses some older members of the Deaf community, younger members have adapted to their environment by modifying their communication accordingly.

The language is getting hijacked by the mainstream, forcing the people who depend on it to adapt.

> Hearing ASL creators have created a fad out of signing over popular music. So many of these signs are exaggerated or inaccurate that the National Association of the Deaf has had to warn about “devastating harm” from ASL TikTok gibberish. Just as with African American English, the structure of social media pushed minority language into a trend, and our mainstream fascination diluted its original importance.

The never-ending linguistic treadmill of new slang is what people of color must climb so they can regain a sense of ownership over something that should belong only to their shared community in a society that doesn't normally afford them much of this kind of privilege. For deaf people, fighting the mainstreaming of their language gets at an even more fundamental need: their sole ability to communicate is being eroded for laughs.

> Hearing people will try and pinpoint” funny-seeming ASL signs and then misuse them.

And yet, social media won't be able to ruin anyone's language, even those relied upon by the most underprivileged and vulnerable among us. Geoffrey Chaucer has noted long ago that people's ability to adapt to new linguistic trends is innate.

> You know that the form of speech will change within a thousand years, and words that were once apt, we now regard as quaint and strange, and yet they spoke them thus and succeeded as well in love as men do now.

Language will forever evolve to serve our needs, even as it, at times, gets temporarily pulled into unproductive territory. It's always in anticipation of a swift course correction.

## What is the main driver of change in a human civilization?

Technology. Once we've learned to use tools, we've largely  outsourced the evolution of our species to them. The dramatic changes in the large collective human organism that is our civilization are largely accomplished not through natural selection but through innovation. Just as a random mutation may confer an organism enough of an advantage that the resulting trait propagates into the future generations, an idea (like a mutation) arises in an individual, and if it's advantageous, it propagates through the collective (the civilization) and dictates the direction of its progress. Such ideas are usually technological.

> The story of mankind has always been told through the tools we create. The Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age caused dramatic shifts in how we lived our daily lives and reshaped our social structures.

Technology propagates into our culture through language. That is, as we take the cue for the future direction of our civilization by learning a new technology from our innovators, we change our language to reflect it.

> We come up with ingenious new ways to use our tools, for both good and bad. Then language reflexively evolves around these new tools, helping us discuss and frame our reality.

As we collectively make sense of the new direction of progress, we deliberate whether the technology at the center of this shift is for the better or worse. We learn to use it responsibly. There's no other choice. Our survival depends on it.
