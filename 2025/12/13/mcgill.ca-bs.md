# [On Bullshit](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/JAC/124/bs.html)

This scholarly paper was referenced by [a scholarly article on bullshit](../../../2025/12/09/rcgphi-deeperintobullshit.md). It answered five questions about lying and bullshitting in life and work.

## What killed artisanship?

Automation and greed. Before automation, people couldn't pretend to work. They couldn't bullshit all week long and then collect a paycheck at the end of it. Things had to be made and money had to be earned. If the work wasn't done by you, there was no one to fall back on, no machine to which to outsource your labor. So, the artisanship culture emerged.

> In the old days, craftsmen did not cut corners. They worked carefully, and they took care with every aspect of their work. Every part of the product was considered, and each was designed and made to be exactly as it should be. These craftsmen did not relax their thoughtful self-discipline even with respect to features of their work which would ordinarily not be visible. Although no one would notice if those features were not quite right, the craftsmen would be bothered by their consciences. So nothing was swept under the rug. Or, one might perhaps also say, there was no bullshit.

No one wants to hire an artisan anymore because artisans demand a fair wage for their no-bullshit labor. Instead, corporations find the cheapest possible means of production, which paradoxically breeds bullshit-producing leeches that fill the corporation's payroll rosters. Bullshit is completely extraneous to work even as it's encouraged by the greedy industrialists.

> The unnecessary routine tasks or ceremonial that constitute bull are disconnected from the legitimating motives of the activity upon which they intrude, just as the things people say in bull sessions are disconnected from their settled beliefs, and as bullshit is disconnected from a concern with the truth.

A bullshitter is no artisan. His bullshit is not something that should be rewarded with money, even as corporations shower bullshitters with it.

> Is the bullshitter by his very nature a mindless slob? Is his product necessarily messy or unrefined? The word shit does, to be sure, suggest this. Excrement is not designed or crafted at all; it is merely emitted, or dumped. It may have a more or less coherent shape, or it may not, but it is in any case certainly not wrought.

A marketing guru may regard his work as artisanal. His product consists of turns of phrase he carefully crafted to be devoid of meaning, so ambiguous that they evade scrutiny, but he may hold them in high regard. Do not let such a person's pompous self-infatuation convince you if the value of his work. It's still bullshit, and there's nothing honest about bullshit.

> However studiously and conscientiously the bullshitter proceeds, it remains true that he is also trying to get away with something. There is surely in his work, as in the work of the slovenly craftsman, some kind of laxity which resists or eludes the demands of a disinterested and austere discipline.

## Why do we resent bullshit?

Not because we resent the bullshitters' incompetence or inadequacy, but rather because they're not even trying to gain any competence or adequate understanding of that if which they speak. They settle for empty, meaningless statements while we all demand more of ourselves and each other. 

> I feel just like a dog that has been run over.

This bullshit phrase was uttered by Fania Pascal, which was then swiftly chastised for it by her opponent. 

> Pascal offers a description of a certain state of affairs without genuinely submitting to the constraints which the endeavor to provide an accurate representation of reality imposes. Her fault is not that she fails to get things right, but that she is not even trying.

Bullshitters are phonies.

> The essence of bullshit is not that it is false but that it is phony.

We resent phonies like we resent counterfeit goods.

> What is wrong with a counterfeit is not what it is like, but how it was made.

Bullshitters exist outside of the world occupied by you and I, the world where a statement is either true or false. Instead, a bullshitter prefers to communicate with a void of communication: empty statements that cannot be classified as true or false.

> Her statement is grounded neither in a belief that it is true nor, as a lie must be, in a belief that it is not true. It is just this lack of connection to a concern with truth — this indifference to how things really are — that I regard as of the essence of bullshit.

We don't understand bullshitters, so we resent them.

> Consider a Fourth of July orator, who goes on bombastically about “our great and blessed country, whose Founding-Fathers under divine guidance created a new beginning for mankind.”

Bullshitters try to manipulate us, and we resent being manipulated.

> The orator does not really care what his audience thinks about the Founding Fathers, or about the role of the deity in our country’s history, or the like. At least, it is not an interest in what anyone thinks about these matters that motivates his speech.

The way bullshitters twist language to suit their needs tells us of the predatory or parasitic nature of their character.

> The orator intends these statements to convey a certain impression of himself. He is not trying to deceive anyone concerning American history. What he cares about is what people think of him. He wants them to think of him as a patriot, as someone who has deep thoughts and feelings about the origins and the mission of our country, who appreciates the importance of religion, who is sensitive to the greatness of our history, whose pride in that history is combined with humility before God, and so on.

A bullshitter is willing to do whatever it takes with their command of language to get is to do what he wants.

> The bullshitter may not deceive us, or even intend to do so, either about the facts or about what he takes the facts to be. What he does necessarily attempt to deceive us about is his enterprise. His only indispensably distinctive characteristic is that in a certain way he misrepresents what he is up to.

It is this disrespect of the truth and the purpose of communication that we find so offensive.

> He does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.

Bullshitters challenge the purportedly agreed-upon idea that the purpose of communication is to exchange information, and we resent them for it.

> When we characterize talk as hot air, we mean that what comes out of the speaker’s mouth is only that. It is mere vapor. His speech is empty, without substance or content. His use of language, accordingly, does not contribute to the purpose it purports to serve. No more information is communicated than if the speaker had merely exhaled. There are similarities between hot air and excrement, incidentally, which make hot air seem an especially suitable equivalent for bullshit. Just as hot air is speech that has been emptied of all informative content, so excrement is matter from which everything nutritive has been removed. Excrement may be regarded as the corpse of nourishment, what remains when the vital elements in food have been exhausted. In this respect, excrement is a representation of death which we ourselves produce and which, indeed, we cannot help producing in the very process of maintaining our lives. Perhaps it is for making death so intimate that we find excrement so repulsive. In any event, it cannot serve the purposes of sustenance, any more than hot air can serve those of cummunication.

We don't understand why bullshitters fill their exhales with gibberish. We resent them because they are wasting our time as we try to decipher their gibberish. Bullshitters are pretending to communicate while they're actually simply performing a bodily function. We resent bullshitters because while they're huffing and puffing in front of us they're standing in the way between us and the truth we are seeking. When we ask a question, we want to get an answer. A bullshitter thinks he must have an opinion on everything, even topics in which he has no expertise. Instead of fessing up to that and letting us move on to someone who would know the answer, they exhaust us with their games, sometimes to the point where we abandon our pursuit of the truth. When institutions become overrun with bullshitters, they cease to provide value.

## Why do people bullshit?

To fill the air when asked a question they don't know the answer to and don't want to admit it or they don't want to answer.

> Bullshit is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about. Thus the production of bullshit is stimulated whenever a person’s obligations or opportunities to speak about some topic are more excessive than his knowledge of the facts that are relevant to that topic.

You don't have to resort to a lying if you can bullshit, says a fictional characters in Eric Ambler’s novel _Dirty Story_.

> Never tell a lie when you can bullshit your way through.

Bullshitting is less work than lying. It is also accessible to more people as it includes those ignorant of the truth. 

> In order to invent a lie at all, he must think he knows what is true. And in order to invent an effective lie, he must design his falsehood under the guidance of that truth. On the other hand, a person who undertakes to bullshit his way through has much more freedom. His focus is panoramic rather than particular. He does not limit himself to inserting a certain falsehood at a specific point, and thus he is not constrained by the truths surrounding that point or intersecting it.

Some people bullshit simply because they're good at it. That's where their talent lies, so they lean into it.

> The mode of creativity upon which it relies is less analytical and less deliberative than that which is mobilized in lying. It is more expansive and independent, with more spacious opportunities for improvisation, color, and imaginative play. This is less a matter of craft than of art. Hence the familiar notion of the “bullshit artist.”

There are a lot more bullshitters than there are compulsive liars.

> There are very few people to whom it would often (or even ever) occur to lie exclusively from a love of falsity or of deception.

People may bullshit because they tried it once and got sucked into it, become addicted to bullshit.

> Telling lies does not tend to unfit a person for telling the truth in the same way that bullshitting tends to. Through excessive indulgence in the latter activity, which involves making assertions without paying attention to anything except what it suits one to say, a person’s normal habit of attending to the ways things are may become attenuated or lost.

Sometimes people resort to bullshit when they try to accomplish a task better suited for insinuation.

> The characteristic topics of a bull session have to do with very personal and emotion-laden aspects of life — for instance, religion, politics, or sex. People are generally reluctant to speak altogether openly about these topics if they expect that they might be taken too seriously. What tends to go on in a bull session is that the participants try out various thoughts and attitudes in order to see how it feels to hear themselves saying such things and in order to discover how others respond, without it being assumed that they are committed to what they say: It is understood by everyone in a bull session that the statements people make do not necessarily reveal what they really believe or how they really feel. The main point is to make possible a high level of candor and an experimental or adventuresome approach to the subjects under discussion. Therefore provision is made for enjoying a certain irresponsibility, so that people will be encouraged to convey what is on their minds without too much anxiety that they will be held to it.

## What is more destructive to society: bullshitting or lying?

Bullshitting. A lie is simply a negation of the truth. It is easy to counter it (e.g., fact-checking). Meanwhile, bullshit exists outside of the truth-lie conflict. It is a distraction for someone seeking the truth.

> Bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are. One who is concerned to report or to conceal the facts assumes that there are indeed facts that are in some way both determinate and knowable. His interest in telling the truth or in lying presupposes that there is a difference between getting things wrong and getting them right.

When you bullshit someone enough, they will stop looking for the truth. A society that drowns in bullshit will not have any certainty of anything. It will become cynical and easy to control.

## Does telling a lie making someone a liar? 

Not necessarily, argues St. Augustine.

> There is a distinction between a person who tells a lie and a liar. The former is one who tells a lie unwillingly, while the liar loves to lie and passes his time in the joy of lying.

You're only a liar if you derive pleasure out of lying, if your lie is real.

> The lie which is told solely for the pleasure of lying and deceiving, that is, the real lie.

Some lies aren't real. Lying out of necessity does not a liar make.
