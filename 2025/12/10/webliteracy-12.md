# [12. Tracking the Source of Viral Photos](https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/chapter/tracking-the-source-of-viral-photo/)

This chapter of [Web Literacy](../../../2025/12/04/webliteracy.md) answered a question about fact-checking.

## How to fact-check a news story?

Trace it back to its source to see it in its original context.

> Get “upstream” to something that is closer to the actual event. One way to do that is to find the earliest post.

Find either the earliest version of it or the most local version of it.

> Get closer to the event in space. Think about it: who is more likely to get the facts of a local story correct, the local newspaper or a random blog? So as you scan the search results, look at the URLs. _Fox 13 News_ has it in “trending.” _AmericaNow_ has it in the “society” section. But the _WGME_ link has the story in a “news/local/” directory.
