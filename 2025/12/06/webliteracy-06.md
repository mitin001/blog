# [6. Wikipedia](https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/chapter/wikipedia/)

This chapter of [Web Literacy](../../../2025/12/04/webliteracy.md) answered a question about the modern-day equivalent of going to the library.

## What is the best place to start your inquiry on a given subject?

Wikipedia. Read the article on the subject of your inquiry, then read the sources it cites. As you immerse yourself in the literature curated by the volunteers who care deeply about getting to the truth in that area, you will soon find yourself well-informed in it as well.

> Because the Wikipedia community has strict rules about sourcing facts to reliable sources, and because authors must adopt a neutral point of view, its articles are often the best available introduction to a subject on the web.
