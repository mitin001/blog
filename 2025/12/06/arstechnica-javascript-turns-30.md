Google must've noticed me engaging with [an article on AI in the context of programming languages](../../../2025/12/04/wired-vibe-coding-engineering-apocalypse.md) because its Android news feed recommended I read an article on the history of JavaScript, which answered three questions about this programming language.

## Why is there the substring _Java_ in _JavaScript_?

Because when JavaScript was created, Java was a trendy technology, and Netscape wanted to capitalize on the name, even though the new language had nothing to do with Java. Kind of like how companies were appending .com to their names then or write AI all over their mission statements now.

> It was a marketing decision meant to capitalize on the buzz around Java at the time. The 1995 press release prominently positioned JavaScript as a complement to Java, with the former handling small client-side tasks while Java powered larger enterprise applications. Bill Joy, Sun’s co-founder and vice president of research, said at the time: “JavaScript will be the most effective method to connect HTML-based content to Java applets.” Confusion about its relationship to Java continues: The two languages share a name, some syntax conventions, and virtually nothing else. Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems using static typing and class-based objects. JavaScript uses dynamic typing and prototype-based inheritance. The distinction between the two languages, as one Stack Overflow user put it in 2010, is similar to the relationship between the words “car” and “carpet.”

And yet, Netscape wanted JavaScript to be like Java because it was trendy, kind of like how companies now want features that won't benefit from AI to still incorporate it in them somehow. So, at the request of management, JavaScript was made to look a little bit like Java.

> The syntax looked like a trendy new programming language called Java to satisfy Netscape management, but its guts borrowed concepts from Scheme, a language Eich admired, and Self, which contributed JavaScript’s prototype-based object model.

Sun Microsystems created Java, so when it started partnering with Netscape, naming Netscape's new programming language after Sun's was a gesture of goodwill for the partnership.

> The JavaScript name arrived in December when Netscape and Sun finalized their partnership.

By now, the trendy technology of the day, Java, has long been an afterthought compared to the world domination of JacaScript.

> Java applets largely vanished from browsers years ago, but JavaScript dominates. The freaky sideshow became the main event.

Perhaps there's a lesson in jumping on the buzzword bandwagon here.

## What saved JavaScript from extinction?

Introducing support for cross-host requests (AJAX). Its non-browser applications (Node.js) then made it ubiquitous.

> The language went through a rocky period in the early 2000s, when Internet Explorer dominated the browser market and innovation stalled somewhat, but the 2005 introduction of AJAX revitalized interest by enabling smoother web applications without full page reloads. Node.js arrived in 2009, letting developers run JavaScript on servers, and the language’s scope expanded far beyond the browser.

To concede that Internet Explorer could've made JavaScript go extinct is unthinkable today.

## What is ECMAScript?

The name of JavaScript in the open-source community. Oracle, which acquired Sun Microsystems, owns the name _JavaScript_, despite not doing anything with it.

> There can be no “JavaScript Conference” or “JavaScript Specification,” forcing community organizations to use awkward workarounds like “JSConf.” Eich himself wrote in 2006 that “ECMAScript,” the official name for the language standard, “was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin disease.”
