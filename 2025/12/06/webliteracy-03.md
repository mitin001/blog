# [3. Building a Fact-Checking Habit](https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/chapter/building-a-habit-by-checking-your-emotions/)

This chapter of [Web Literacy](../../../2025/12/04/webliteracy.md) answered a question about an amygdala hijack.

## What to do when a social media post overwhelms you with emotion? 

Do not share it.

> When you feel strong emotion–happiness, anger, pride, vindication–and that emotion pushes you to share a “fact” with others, STOP. Above all, these are the claims that you must fact-check.

Emotion is a human vulnerability propagandists exploit to make us stop thinking and spread their propaganda for them.

> Our normal inclination is to ignore verification needs when we react strongly to content.

Our brains can both process emotions and think rationally, but not at the same time. A strong emotional response must be caught before it hijacks your whole brain. Once you catch the emotion in its tracks, redirect your brain activity into rational thinking. Analyze what caused the emotion.

> Use your emotions as a reminder. Strong emotions should become a trigger for your new fact-checking habit. Every time content you want to share makes you feel rage, laughter, ridicule, or even a heartwarming buzz, spend 30 seconds fact-checking. It will do you well.

Open the comment section to see if anyone has already debunked the arousing claim. If not, do the job yourself. Fact-check the claim and write a comment reporting the results.
