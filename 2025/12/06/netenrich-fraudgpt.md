This article was referenced by [an article about FraudGPT](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-fraudgpt), which, in turn, was referenced by [an article about vibe hacking](../../../2025/11/08/wired-ai-hacker.md). It answered a question about trust on the darknet.

## How to get cybercriminals on the darknet to trust you? 

Impersonate an already trusted account, preferably one that's no longer active. There will be others who try to do the same, but you can stave off suspicion by inventing a story about your account getting autodeleted while you were on vacation or whatever.

> i have proudly served as a verified vendor for 4+ years on some of the most well known marketplaces across the globe. Through out that time i have maintained an impressive 90% positive sales rating. With over 3,000 confirmed sales and hundreds of verified reviews from satisfied customers. However a few months ago i took a much needed break only to return and find my telegram account has been auto deleted. This unfortunate incident allowed imposters to claim my old username @CanadianSmoker12 as well as take over old group names, bot names, etc. To make an unfortunate situation worse my pgp key expired thus locking me out of my vendor pages that were on vacation mode.
