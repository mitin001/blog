# [Non-ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation)

This Wikipedia article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on the adverse effects of wireless device radiation on human health](../../../2025/11/05/wikipedia_wireless_device_radiation_and_health.md). It answered two questions about electromagnetic radiation.

## What happens to matter when electromagnetic radiation passes through it?

It depends on the energy of the photon that collides with the atom. If the energy is above the ionization energy of an atom (i.e., >10eV) and it encounters an electron, the electron will be knocked off the atom. If the energy is below the ionization threshold, then the photon will excite the particle it strikes without causing an ejection of an electron. When there are enough of such excitations, the temperature of the object bombarded by EMR rises.

> The energy of non-ionizing radiation is low, and instead of producing charged ions when passing through matter, it has only sufficient energy to change the rotational, vibrational or electronic valence configurations of molecules and atoms. This produces thermal effects.

UV radiation is between non-ionizing and ionizing radiation on the ionization continuum. Even the non-ionizing near-UV radiation has high enough energy to produce free radicals.

> Near ultraviolet radiation, although technically non-ionizing, may still excite and cause photochemical reactions in some molecules. This happens because at ultraviolet photon energies, molecules may become electronically excited or promoted to free-radical form, even without ionization taking place.

Ionization is not the only way to damage the DNA molecule.

> Pyrimidine dimer formation in DNA can happen through most of the UV band, including much of the band that is formally non-ionizing.

## What part of the electromagnetic spectrum is sunlight?

Mostly infrared.

> Bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kilowatt per square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 527 watts is infrared radiation, 445 watts is visible light, and 32 watts is ultraviolet radiation.

Sunlight is the main source of ultraviolet radiation, and yet, it is only 3% ultraviolet radiation. Note that the sun is so hot that its thermal radiation includes ionizing radiation (e.g., UV-C). When you're out in the sun, your body is irradiated with infrared radiation with the power density of over 500 W/m², visible light with the power density of over 400 W/m², and UV radiation with the power density of over 30 W/m². You can feel the photons getting absorbed by your body as its temperature rises, especially on the surface. An antenna is like the sun in the sense that it irradiates us with electromagnetic radiation, except it's all radiofrequency radiation (far less energetic than infrared) with the power density of no more than [10 W/m²](https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=112567) (averaged over 30 minutes of sustained exposure). If the FCC allowed manufacture of antennas emitting radiation at a much higher power density, we would be able to feel the thermal effects from that, just like the sun, even as the energy of the emitted photons is much lower.
