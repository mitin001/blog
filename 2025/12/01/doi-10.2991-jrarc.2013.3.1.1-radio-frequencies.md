# [Risk Assessment of Radio Frequencies and Public Information](https://doi.org/10.2991/jrarc.2013.3.1.1)

This scholarly paper was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on the adverse effects of wireless device radiation on human health](../../../2025/11/05/wikipedia_wireless_device_radiation_and_health.md). It answered a question about radiofrequency radiation.

## Why are radio frequencies not considered ionizing radiation? 

When the photons of these frequencies come in contact with molecules, they can't transfer enough energy to them as to separate electrons from them (covert the molecules into ions).

> They do not carry enough energy to induce damage within molecules through chemical ionizing reactions.
