# [2. Four Moves](https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/chapter/four-strategies/)

This chapter of [Web Literacy](../../../2025/12/04/webliteracy.md) answered a question about the sunk costs fallacy.

## Why should you never hesitate to abandon something that's not working because of sunk costs? 

If you've already invested so much in something, and it's not working, your investment wasn't in vain. You've paid for invaluable knowledge: that something you've tried is not the right way of doing it. When you start over, you might just discover that investing so much of your time in the dead end made you into a person who can now solve this problem. All you need might just be a different approach.

> If you get lost, hit dead ends, or find yourself going down an increasingly confusing rabbit hole, back up and start over knowing what you know now. You’re likely to take a more informed path with different search terms and better decisions.
