# [Vibe Coding Is Coming for Engineering Jobs](https://www.wired.com/story/vibe-coding-engineering-apocalypse/)

This article was referenced by [an article about vibe coding](https://www.wired.com/story/why-did-a-10-billion-dollar-startup-let-me-vibe-code-for-them-and-why-did-i-love-it/), which, in turn, was referenced by [an article on the post-AI world](../../../2025/11/06/wired-ai-plateaus.md). It answered two questions about software engineering and what's next in the field.

## Now that AI is writing code, do software engineers have to worry about retraining into a different job role? 

Vibe-coding enthusiasts seem to think so.

> Engineering was once the most stable and lucrative job in tech. Then AI learned to code.

As the same time, just as there's a rise in AI-produced code, there's also a rise in AI-produced bugs, and a skilled software engineer is needed to fix them.

> Relying too much on AI could result in a glut of buggy and hackable code, as well as a shortage of developers with the knowledge and skills needed to write good software.

Software engineers are becoming harder to find with any script kiddie who only learned to prompt an LLM applying for engineering jobs. If you have the software engineering skills, make yourself visible, and you will still have a well-paying job.

> Not only will we have masses of broken code, full of security vulnerabilities, but we'll have a new generation of programmers incapable of dealing with those vulnerabilities.

Vibe coding requires a lot of—far too much—monitoring and correction.

> Those dabbling in the field often report running into problems, including introducing unforeseen security issues, creating features that only simulate real functionality, accidentally running up high bills using AI tools, and ending up with broken code and no idea how to fix it.

A software engineer can provide a guarantee of functionality. AI cannot.

> There are almost no applications in which ‘mostly works’ is good enough.

Skilled engineers aren't the ones sounding the alarm at the AI coder.

> “We are not seeing less demand for developers,” says Liad Elidan, CEO of Milestone, a company that helps firms measure the impact of generative AI projects. “We are seeing less demand for average or low-performing developers.”

AI is just one more way to talk to computers. There are countless others, and being skilled in them makes you fit to solve the great many problems AI will never be able to solve.

> Understanding how to get the most out of computers is likely to remain extremely valuable.

## Are all programming languages the same? 

No, there are different levels of programming languages. Machines understand the machine language, but humans don't, so CPU manufacturers created a level of abstraction for the machine language: the assembly language. As computers became ubiquitous, and the need for programming them followed in demand, another abstraction was created: higher-level languages that could be compiled into assembly and that were even more understandable by humans. With the advent of AI, we can now essentially program computers with prompts written in natural human languages. AI translates our prompts into programming languages.

> This is the most dramatic shift in the art of computer science since assembly was supplanted by higher-level languages.

In the evolution of the software engineering discipline, AI is simply continuing where Python left off. That doesn't mean other languages and the demand for engineers skilled in them will disappear.

> New languages have typically broadened the appeal of programming and increased the number of practitioners. AI could similarly increase the number of people capable of producing working code.
