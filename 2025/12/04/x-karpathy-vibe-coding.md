# [Vibe Coding](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383)

This post was referenced by [an article on vibe coding](../../../2025/12/04/wired-vibe-coding-engineering-apocalypse.md). It defined vibe coding. 

## What is vibe coding? 

The term embraced by the industry was coined by someone who seemed to be writing satire.

> I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it.

The practice lauded by the industry as the future of all software engineering was borne out of the basest kind of laziness.

> Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.

The mind behind vibe coding also explains to us how software engineers will no longer need the keyboard nor the mouse. Vibe coding can be done purely with speech.

> I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard.

Go ahead, lose your skills. When your LLM buries software companies in slop that doesn't work half the time, there will be more money to go around for the rest of us to fix it. And we will be charging a premium.
