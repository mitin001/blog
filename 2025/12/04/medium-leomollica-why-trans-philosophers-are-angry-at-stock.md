# [Why Trans Philosophers are Angry at Stock](https://medium.com/@leomollica/why-trans-philosophers-are-angry-at-stock-c11fcf338d0d)

This post was referenced by [a post about Kathleen Stock](../../../2025/11/10/praile-kathleen-stock-obe.md). It answered a question about strawman arguments and a question about labels in the trans community.

## Why is it a bad tactic to try to wear down your opponent in debate with a strawman argument? 

Because it will be called out as such, and you will lose credibility. Respond to what your opponent actually said, not what you imagine he said. Do not respond to a strawman. When Kathleen Stock wrote an essay responding to what she imagined the trans community stands for, not what it actually stands for, she was universally and scathingly decried in the trans community.

> She resorts to the tactic of just imagining what her opponents might say, without ever citing any academic (or even non-academic: I’ve seen more nuanced discussions of the topic on Tumblr!) treatment of the relevant questions. This is not the way intellectually serious people converse on sensitive topics in public fora. She does not, incidentally, imagine these conversations correctly. The feigned counterarguments are, as we would expect of a propagandist, not representative of her adversaries’ actual arguments, but of her own rhetorical needs.

## Who should decide what terminology to use to refer to trans people? 

Trans people. When you're talking to a community made of human beings, ask the human beings how they prefer to be addressed. The trans community refers to its members as _trans men_ and _trans women_ and the outsiders _cis men_ and _cis women_, where _cis_ is simply an antonym of _trans_. It is not derogatory; it is objective. When a cis person (like Kathleen Stock) proposes other labels for trans people, a representative of the trans community will ask, likely with a degree of annoyance, why this cis person won't use the terms that are already in common use in their community.

> Why not avail herself of them? Because, in short, they are the trans community’s terms, and Stock thinks we should have no say in how we’re discussed.

If you see that someone refuses to use the community-approved labels to refer to people in the community, dig deeper. You will likely find that this person doesn't want the community to exist at all, and if that's not an option, they'd rather have it exist with significant limitations.

> Stock insists she thinks I and women like me “should be treated as women in most ordinary social contexts.” A funny use of the phrase “ordinary social contexts” that excludes recreation, the bathroom, or anything remotely related to dating.

Scrutinizing the work of Kathleen Stock left at least one member of the trans community in an uproar. 

> Stock is not engaged in doing philosophy, or at least if she is she is doing so badly. She is engaged instead in an attempt to erase trans people from the realm of those whose needs and pains and longings matter, from the world of people, from the Kingdom of Ends. And that she is certainly doing badly—wickedly, sinfully, cruelly—because that is the only way one can do it.
