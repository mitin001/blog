This article was referenced by [an article pointing out the existence of institutions worthy of our trust](https://hapgood.us/2018/11/27/cynicism-not-gullibility-will-kill-our-humanity/), which, in turn, was referenced by [an article on resilience to misinformation](../../../2025/11/03/edsurge-recalibrating-our-approach-to-misinformation.md). It answered a question about propaganda.

## How to spot a statement intended to mislead?

An over-the-top statement intended to elicit strong emotion in an attempt to silence your rational mind is likely manipulating you into accepting the claim without examining it critically.

> Anything that appeals directly to the "lizard brain" is designed to short-circuit our critical thinking. And these kinds of appeals are very often created by active agents of deception.

It is also manipulating you into passing it along to others.

> These days, statements of all stripes are bombarding us via broadcast and social media. The trick is classifying them correctly before we swallow them ourselves, much less before we hit "Like," "Share" or "Retweet."

One doesn't need to scroll too far on social media before encountering a claim created with classic tricks of deception.

> Americans are drowning in a tsunami of ignorance! There is a conspiracy at the highest levels to replace all knowledge with propaganda and disinformation.

This statement is cartoonishly over-the-top. It also deliberately avoids placing itself in the context of any larger body of information.

> A florid, mislabeled statement of opinion with an unverifiable, overgeneralized, ideological claim ("conspiracy at the highest levels").

A statement that wasn't created to mislead wouldn't have tried to obscure the truth with emotion. It would also cite its source. It would sound diplomatic.

> More measured in tone and limited in scope. And, it has a link that goes straight to the original source: a press release from a reputable university.

The authors give an example of such a claim.

> A recent Stanford University report found that more than 80 percent of middle schoolers didn't understand that the phrase "sponsored content" meant "advertising."

This is what useful information sounds like. It's not flashy, but it's closer to the truth. It can be easily fact-checked, and thus, it deserves your trust.
