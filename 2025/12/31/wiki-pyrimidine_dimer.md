# [Pyrimidine dimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimidine_dimer)

This Wikipedia article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on non-ionizing radiation](../../../2025/12/01/wikipedia_non-ionizing_radiation.md). It answered two questions about the way UV radiation damages DNA.

## What is a molecular lesion?

The site of damage in a molecule. The word _lesion_ is borrowed from medicine. Damage to skin will leave observable signs of damage (blisters, growths, bumps, spots, etc). Medical professionals call these lesions. Lesions can occur in any type of tissue on any scale. When a molecule is damaged, what results is called a molecular lesion. For example, when UV radiation reaches two adjacent thymine bases on one side of the DNA molecule, a thymine dimer lesion may form. This will leave the DNA molecule with a kink or bend at that site, which may interfere with its transcription.

Adjacent thymines are the most vulnerable portion of the DNA molecule to damage by UV radiation. The thymines can fuse in such a way as to produce a 6–4 pyrimidine–pyrimidone, 6–4 pyrimidine–pyrimidinone, or (most common) a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD).

> Thymine–thymine CPDs are the most common lesions induced by UV.

When an abnormal structure like a CPD follows a normal sequence of pyrimidines (thymines and cytosines) or purines (adenines and guanines) in a DNA strand, that's a molecular lesion. On the other side of the DNA molecule (the complementary strand), the N1-N6 sites of the adenines that previously formed hydrogen bonds with the thymines now remain unbonded.

## If UV radiation reaches a DNA molecule, does it damage it irreparably?

No. If UV radiation has reached a DNA molecule, chances are it has also reached lyases, which have evolved to activate DNA repair processes in response to UV radiation. That is, if you're a lifeform that has evolved photoreactivation, then the UV-induced CPDs in your DNA molecules will be repaired by a process that's also UV-induced.

> In most organisms (excluding placental mammals such as humans) they can be repaired by photoreactivation. Photoreactivation is a repair process in which photolyase enzymes reverse CPDs using photochemical reactions.

Humans have evolved a mechanism that doesn't bet on photoreactivation and photoproduct formation to occur at the same time. The trigger for DNA repair in humans is the definitive presence of DNA lesions. Since UV radiation damages only one DNA strand (the one with adjacent thymines), the undamaged complementary strand can be used to restore the damaged one.

> Nucleotide excision repair (NER), sometimes termed "dark reactivation", is a more general mechanism for repair of lesions and is the most common form of DNA repair for pyrimidine dimers in humans. This process works by using cellular machinery to locate the dimerized nucleotides and excise the lesion. Once the CPD is removed, there is a gap in the DNA strand that must be filled. DNA machinery uses the undamaged complementary DNA strand as a template to synthesize the matching nucleotides and consequently fill in the gap on the damaged strand.

The prevalence of cancer among individuals with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), people with defective reactivation DNA repair mechanisms, shows us how much we rely on DNA repair mechanisms to protect us from cancer. 

> Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genetic disease in humans that is caused by UV damage to genes that code for NER proteins, resulting in the inability for the cell to combat pyrimidine dimers that form. Individuals with XP are also at a much higher risk of cancer, with a >5,000-fold increased risk of developing skin cancers compared to the general population.
