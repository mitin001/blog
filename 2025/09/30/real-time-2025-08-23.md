## Why is Gavin Newsom writing his social media posts like Donald Trump?

> This is imitating him. This is aping him.

Gavin Newsom is showing the ridiculousness of Trump by adopting his style on the Internet. So, now that this brand of stupidity is coming from someone other than Trump, maybe Trump fans will finally realize that having a president like this is not normal.

> Gavin has grasped the essential thing about American culture in this day and age. Don't try to outsmart people. You have to outstupid them.

Also, he's doing it for attention. Trump is always tending, and riding a trend is a smart thing to do in the attention economy.
