## What does it mean to "take the red pill" or "become redpilled" for young men in online communities?

Meme expert Aidan Walker explains.

> If you take the red pill, then you've broken out of what they call kind of the oppressive reality of mainstream society, of respecting people who are different from you, of believing that games that we play in life are fair, and so for them, taking the red pill means like being one of them, being one of these incels outside of the way that most of us do business and conduct ourselves.

## What is Christian nationalism in America?

> The inappropriate commingling of politics and Christianity in a country that is supposed to have a separation of church and state.

This is how Bill Maher defines it.
