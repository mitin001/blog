# [Hacker's Manifesto](https://phrack.org/issues/7/3)

While reading Ctrl+Alt+Chaos, I learned of the Hacker's Manifesto. It answered some questions I had about the psychology of hacking.

## What are hackers looking for on the other side of the computer screen? 

True intellectual stimulation, a real challenge, a refuge from boredom.

> I am a hacker, enter my world... Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...

Hackers are gifted children,for whom school assignments are trivial. They hunger for hard problems.

> I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..." Damn kid.  Probably copied it. They're all alike.

Hackers want an endless stream of challenges, and school doesn't provide it to them.

> We've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless.

Gifted children living in a system which prioritizes the average will flock to the cyberworld because this is where they will finally be treated fairly.

> I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me... Or feels threatened by me... Or thinks I'm a smart ass... Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here... Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.

Hackers are annoyed by incompetent people, and the cyberworld is a refuge away from them.

> A door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. "This is it... this is where I belong..."

## What possessed The Mentor to write the Hacker's Manifesto?

This about when it was written.

> Shortly after my arrest.

The rush of emotions from getting caught poured out of this man onto the page.

## How do hackers justify their crimes? 

They believe their crimes are inconsequential and shouldn't be considered crimes at all. They only steal that which should already be free. They gain "unauthorized access" to that which should already be open to everyone. They thwart the status quo.

> We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
