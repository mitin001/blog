## Is nothing sacred anymore? Is nothing safe from political division?

Apparently not, judging by the Charlie Kirk funeral. It was a spectacle in political speech. Most of the attendees spoke in a gross, self-serving manner.

> Our politics have permeated the most sacred spaces.

## Is Jimmy Kimmel's return a cause for celebration?

No, he's returned to a dying genre of television and into Trump's crosshairs on a network that doesn't seem to care about protecting its greatest assets. Jimmy Kimmel has returned after being suspended by ABC due to the pressure from the Trump administration. The cancellation of Stephen Colbert has already signified that late night talk shows are a dying genre.

> He is sitting on top of a melting ice cube.
