# [When to Rob a Bank]. 01-11. Would Paying Politicians More Attract Better Politicians?

This section of the last [Freakonomics] volume answered two questions I had about politicians.

## How to make politicians keep their campaign promises?

Tie their pay to their promises, and they will start delivering on them. Misaligned incentives are the reason why politicians don't serve the people who elected them.

> One big problem with politics is that politicians’ incentives are generally not aligned well with the incentives of the electorate. Voters want politicians to help solve hard problems that have long-term time frames: transportation, health care, education, economic development, geopolitical affairs, and so on. The politicians, meanwhile, have strong incentives to act in their own interests (getting elected, raising money, consolidating power, etc.), most of which have short-term payouts. So as much as we may dislike how many politicians act, they’re simply responding to the incentives the system puts before them. But what if, instead of paying politicians a flat rate for their work, thereby encouraging them to exploit their office for personal gains that may go against the collective good, we incentivized them to work hard for the collective good?

## What does it take to be a politician?

Being fully engaged with the person speaking to them, letting them say their piece, then shaking their hand, wishing them good luck, and walking away, committing to nothing.

> I recently had the chance to talk through the idea with Senator John McCain. He listened carefully—nodding, smiling, the whole bit. I couldn’t believe how engaged he was. This only encouraged me to go on and on, in great detail. Finally, he reached to shake my hand. “That’s a neat idea, Steve,” he said, “and good luck to hell with that!” He turned and walked away, still smiling. I have never felt so good about being so fully rejected. I guess that’s what it takes to be a great politician.
