Wikipedians have [loudly] expressed their thoughts on AI, and one of the problems they identified with AI was that it can violate copyright. This Wikipedia essay answered one question I had about LLMs and copyright.

## If LLMs have been trained on copyrighted material, do their outputs violate copyright? 

Sometimes, just as a human exposed to a copyrighted work can be determined to violate its copyright by producing a work deemed too similar to it.

> Human brains are themselves neural networks; much has been said, in a variety of fields, on the subject of whether humans create original works versus whether they merely juxtapose or recombine motifs and concepts that they're exposed to through participation in society.

Artificial neural networks are a simplified model of the human brain, and by the nature of their simplicity, they are more prone to produce works that are too similar to what they have been trained on. However, like humans, they can produce work that can be considered original.

> Neural networks which have been exposed to copyrighted material in the course of their existence are capable of later creating original works under the purview of intellectual property law.
