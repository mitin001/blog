# [State v. Limberhand](https://www.cetient.com/case/state-v-limberhand-1293349)

While reading the section on aptonyms in the last [Freakonomics] volume, I learned of the case of Limberhand, a man accused of public masturbation. The freakonomists remarked that by having invited such an accusation, this man has lived up to his name. The case itself answered four questions about the criminalization of homosexuality and the justice system.

## How do people get out of drug possession charges? 

They prove to the court that the police officer didn't have the right to obtain the evidence (their drugs).

> Limberhand was arrested for participating in obscene live conduct, I.C. ยง 18-4104, after an undercover officer observed him masturbating in a closed toilet stall, in a public restroom at a rest area along Interstate 90 in northern Idaho. He was taken by the police to the Kootenai County jail. When Limberhand emptied his pockets in the course of being booked into the jail, a small quantity (less than three ounces) of marijuana was found and seized by the police, giving rise to an additional charge of misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance, I.C. ยง 37-2732(c). After Limberhand appeared before a magistrate on the charges, he moved to suppress all evidence obtained by the officers, on the ground that the undercover officer's observations of him in the rest stop toilet stall constituted an illegal search in violation of the United States and Idaho Constitutions.

Since the evidence was obtained illegally, it is inadmissible.

> The magistrate agreed and ordered suppression of the evidence, finding that Limberhand had a reasonable expectation of privacy in an enclosed toilet stall.

If there is no other evidence of your drug possession, the court pretends it didn't see it.

> The state then conceded that it had no evidence with which to proceed on either charge in light of the magistrate's suppression ruling.

Court decisions can be challenged (appealed to a different court), but apellate decisions can be challenged back.

> The state appealed to the district court. The district court reversed the magistrate's determination on the ground that the conduct observed by the police officer was in "plain view" and therefore was not observed by an unconstitutional search. Limberhand then brought this appeal from the district court's decision.

## How much money would the state of Idaho waste investigating a single report of homosexual activity in the late 1980s?

Far too much. A single report of homosexual activity could summon as many as nine police agents.

> In early June, 1987, the Idaho Department of Law Enforcement and the Idaho State Police conducted an investigation at the eastbound rest area of Interstate 90, near Huetter, Idaho, in Kootenai County, in response to reports of homosexual activity. The investigation involved approximately eight police agents, unmarked police vehicles and an undercover officer wearing a body transmitter.

## What methods did undercover officers use to arrest homosexuals?

They entrapped them. A perfect trap would be a bathroom stall with a glory hole in it.

> About three feet above the floor level, a hole with a diameter of approximately four inches had been made through the common partition, evidently with a cutting torch.

Even when an officer investigating a report of homosexual activity found no such activity to be taking place, he would attempt to elicit it from passers-by. Such attempts did not always work.

> On June 5, 1987, Idaho State Police Officer Komosinski equipped with a transmitter operated as an undercover agent at the rest area. Komosinski entered the restroom and found it unoccupied. He noticed the hole in the partition between the two toilet stalls. He plugged the hole with toilet paper for reasons not disclosed by the record and left the restroom. A short time thereafter, Komosinski observed an individual, later identified as the defendant, Limberhand, enter the restroom. After waiting one to two minutes, Komosinski reentered the restroom and noted that Limberhand occupied one of the stalls.

Preparing to elicit homosexual activity from a stranger, an officer would plug a glory hole in a bathroom stall. If the toilet paper fell out of the glory hole, then the officer could tell the court that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy. He surrendered his Fourth Amendment protections when he unplugged the glory hole. The problem with this line of reasoning is that the defendant can claim, with equal credibility, that he's never removed the toilet paper from the glory hole deliberately, that it's fallen off on its own. Defendant Limberhand could not be entrapped out of Fourth Amendment protections by the glory hole even though the toilet paper had fallen out of it.

> Regardless of the four-inch hole in the partition, Limberhand's expectation of privacy within the toilet stall is one we believe society would recognize as objectively reasonable.

The defendant also couldn't be entrapped by being propositioned by the undercover officer.

> Komosinski initiated a conversation with Limberhand, for the purpose of luring him away from the restroom area for arrest by inviting Limberhand to accompany him to a nearby motel. Limberhand turned down Komosinski's proposition. As Komosinski left the stall, he told Limberhand that if Limberhand changed his mind, he would be waiting outside.

With all the usual methods of entrapment failing, the undercover officer decided to arrest him anyway, and if nothing turned up post-arrest, he could simply allege that the defendant was masturbating in the stall.

> When Komosinski left the rest stop, Limberhand followed. They travelled east on the Interstate at about fifty miles per hour until a uniformed police officer in a patrol car stopped Limberhand.

Luckily for the officer, the defendant was found in the possession of a small quantity of marijuana. Unfortunately for the officer, neither charge could stick to the defendant because all of the evidence (the drugs as well as his eyewitness testimony of public masturbation) was deemed to have been collected illegally, which rendered it inadmissible.

## Is it illegal for a man to masturbate in a stall if a public bathroom? 

No, as long as he's doing so privately. Limberhand couldn't be charged with obscene conduct when an undercover officer observed him masturbating in a stall.

> The magistrate reasonably inferred Limberhand did not desire his conduct to be viewed by the public but was utilizing the features of the stall to prevent exposure.

Had an eyewitness pressed charges against the defendant from seeing him masturbate in public, the burden of proof of an intent to conceal this activity would be on the defendant. However, since the police engaged in a warrantless search of the defendant, it's on the state to prove it had reasonable suspicion to do so.

> The state has the burden of proving that a warrantless search was reasonable and that, failing to do so, the search was illegal pursuant to the United States and Idaho Constitutions.

The defendant would've been able to masturbate in a stall of a public bathroom with impunity, regardless of who could see him do it, because the defendant took the step of protecting his privacy by entering the stall. If an eyewitness peers into the stall to watch the defendant masturbate, they can't claim that their right to not be disturbed by obscene conduct of another was trampled on. Similarly, a police officer cannot use any evidence collected from him peering into the stall.

> The privacy interest generated within a bathroom stall is to be free from visual intrusion.

Had the defendant himself peered through the hole outside of the stall, as was the case in a different court case, that would cause him to lose his Fourth Amendment protections.

> Defendant's conduct of peering through holes in wall while in the stall indicated to the police officer that there was no expectation of privacy.
