This section of the last [Freakonomics] volume answered the age-old question about the power of exposure.

## Is there such a thing as bad publicity?

No publicity is bad publicity, not even a natural disaster. Surprisingly many people name their children after hurricanes. The prevalence of the name Katrina given to babies born after Hurricane Katrina jumped significantly in the areas affected by this disaster.

> In the two states most severely affected by Hurricane Katrina, the name actually received more action in the twelve months following the storm than in the twelve months previous. In Louisiana, the name increased from eight incidences to fifteen, while in Mississippi, it spiked from seven to twenty-four. (I am guessing that the rate of Katrina namings increased even more, since lots of displaced people from both states were having babies—maybe named Katrina—elsewhere.) Maybe new parents in Louisiana named their babies Katrina as affirmation that they’d lived through the storm, a kind of hair-of-the-dog naming treatment. Maybe they named their girls Katrina to commemorate friends or relatives who died or lost their homes.

Never underestimate the power of exposure. Repeat the same name over and over again, no matter the context, and people will name their child after it, remember it, and vote for it. There's no such thing as bad publicity.
