# [How refrigeration took over the world](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5553615)

This episode of [Planet Money](../../../2025/10/23/planet-money.md) answered three questions about refrigerator history I didn't even know I had.

## How did refrigerators contribute to the feminist movement?

> The slow erosion of the patriarchy.

Pre-refrigerator, women had too much work to do around the house to worry about finding work outside the house.

> Canning fruits and vegetables in the summer to last through the winter and then shopping every day, if they lived in the city, trying to buy fresh food for that evening's meals. There's no such thing as leftover. There's no such thing as frozen convenience food. And as home refrigeration, frozen food expands in the 20th century, well, guess what rises in lockstep? Women in the workforce.

Divorce rates also rose.

## How did refrigerators contribute to the push for Irish independence?

> A lot of beef for the English was raised in Ireland, but once frozen beef could be imported from places like South America, then the price of Irish beef went way down. And that made life really hard in Ireland. It fueled discontent among the Irish tenant farmers and made British landlords more willing to sell their land.

The discontent turned into violence. The Irish challenged the violence into the fight for their independence from the British. 

## How to configure your refrigerator for optimal energy efficiency?

Turn the thermostat in your freezer from -18°C to -15°C.

> It's been estimated that just that tiny move, moving frozen food around at minus 15, which is perfectly safe, is equivalent of getting like 4 million cars off the road.

This will have no negative effect on your food, but measurable effect on the reduction of your carbon footprint.

> Refrigeration accounts for 2% of the world's emissions. That's on par with aviation. And that number is set to grow rapidly, as much of the developing world builds out its own cold chain.

Everything has a price.

> It's a sad irony that as we build more and more artificially cold space, our naturally cold space disappears, thanks to climate change.

If you want to have control over lowering the temperature of your air, the actions you take to do so will raise the baseline from which you'd have to cool it. You're working against not just nature but your own negative externalities.
