## How can one see the world as another person? How can one experience consciousness exactly the way another person experiences consciousness?

Perhaps if you could connect your nervous tissue to a machine that could replicate every signal that travels through the nervous tissue of another person into your nervous tissue. It's been long known (since at least 1868) that an irritation of the nervous tissue produces the experience of consciousness, as documented by the kinds of questions the likes of Thomas Huxley were asking at the time.

> How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue?

## How far out are we from having our cameras achieve the image resolution of the human eye?

We are already there. [130-megapixel cameras] can be created by pairing a scanner with a manual photo lens. 130 megapixels is the image resolution of the human eye.

>  The eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye where there are 130 million photoreceptors, so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.

## How accurate is human vision? 

Just accurate enough to be useful for survival and reproduction.

> Those of our ancestors who saw more accurately had a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately, and therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes. We are the offspring of those who saw more accurately, and so we can be confident that, in the normal case, our perceptions are accurate.

There's a trade-off between vision accuracy and processing speed. Natural selection had to find a way to make vision both fast and accurate.

> Accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions. They give you a survival advantage.

Natural selection is the great optimizer. It found the optimal intersection of vision accuracy and processing speed for the organism possessing these to get away from predators and other dangerous situations, survive, and reproduce.

>  Evolutionarily speaking, vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate.

However, studies of living organisms that have undergone the same selection pressures as humans suggest that vision relies heavily on heuristics. For example, the male Australian jewel beetle mistake beer bottles for their females.

> As it happens, these bottles are dimpled, glossy, and just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles. The males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate. They lose all interest in the real females. Classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle.

The inaccuracy of their vision almost caused these species to be wiped off the planet.

> The species almost went extinct. Australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles.

Vision is only as accurate as is necessary to let us survive and reproduce. The longer a species spends in an unchanging environment, the more their vision becomes an abstraction of this environment.

> Perception of reality goes extinct. In almost every simulation, organisms that see none of reality but are just tuned to fitness drive to extinction all the organisms that perceive reality as it is. So the bottom line is, evolution does not favor veridical, or accurate perceptions.

Just like a desktop metaphor is an abstraction for using a computer without getting bogged down by the details of its inner workings like circuits and instructions, so is human vision is an abstraction that hides the inner workings of reality.

> Evolution has given us an interface that hides reality and guides adaptive behavior. Space and time, as you perceive them right now, are your desktop. Physical objects are simply icons in that desktop.

## Is it true that the more complex a species is, the more likely it is to go extinct when the environment changes?

Yes, the complexity has arisen out of the species spending a long time in a specific, unchanging environment and adapting to it. The species becomes a tight fit for their environment. When the environment changes, the organisms inhabiting it are no longer a tight fit. Even when a species has successfully adapted to selection pressures in the past, it does not mean they can do so in the future. Quite the contrary: the organism has become more complex, and so it is harder to change. Every selection pressure is different: some lead to adaptation and others lead to extinction. The Australian jewel beetles give us an example of that. They've become reliant on a heuristic to find their mates so when humans introduced garbage into their environment that matched this heuristic better, they started mating with the garbage.

> The males had successfully found females for thousands, perhaps millions of years. It looked like they saw reality as it is, but apparently not. Evolution had given them a hack. A female is anything dimpled, glossy and brown, the bigger the better.

Heuristics that evolved as adaptations to the selection pressures of the past are hard to unlearn.

>  Even when crawling all over the bottle, the male couldn't discover his mistake.

## What is the nature of reality? 

This is an open question. So far, it's been proven that reality is not as we perceive it to be. Perception has evolved to make us reliant on heuristics to make just enough sense of reality to survive and reproduce.

> What we have is one theory that turned out to be false, that perception is like reality and reality is like our perceptions. That theory turns out to be false. Okay, throw that theory away. That doesn't stop us from now postulating all sorts of other theories about the nature of reality, so it's actually progress to recognize that one of our theories was false. So science continues as normal.

Even though our perception does not reveal to us the true nature of reality, Donald Hoffman is confident that science will.

## If perception is not reality, then logic or mathematics is not the truth? 

Not likely. The fact that there are selection pressures to make perception differ from reality in ways to make it more useful for the perceiver's survival does not mean that the same selection pressuress apply to math or logic. They have different selection pressures.

> There are some selection pressures for our logic and our mathematics to be at least in the direction of truth.
