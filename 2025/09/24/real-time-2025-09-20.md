This episode of [Real Time] answered two questions I didn't even know I had.

## Is safetyism making kids stupider?

Of course not, but it's a premise for a funny joke.

> It's time we admit that one reason our kids' test scores are going down is that we no longer make playgrounds designed to weed out the stupid ones.

## Are helicopters more dangerous than planes?

Yes, at least for the fact that the rotor blade can hit you.

> If ducking down when you get out of a helicopter is the only thing keeping the blade from chopping your head off, then maybe it's best just to wait till the fucking thing comes to a stop.

Helicopter blades can be loose. They can go low. They can even hit a cockpit.

> When you're on a plane, they don't even let you stand up until you're at a full stop at the gate, but helicopters? _Yeah, you're good to go. Watch your head._ Watch it roll off your neck.

Helicopters cater to a whole different demographic than planes. Helicopters are for the risk takers.
