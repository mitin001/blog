This episode of [On with Kara Swisher] answered three questions about language in the information age.

## What is language?

> Language is a way that humans have to identify what's happening in the world and talk to other humans about it.

There are variations in language used across different groups of people. It doesn't mean one group is worse than another. It's just that their expertise varies. People who use derogatory labels may simply lack the proper understanding and the proper vocabulary to refer to the populations they otherwise seem to hold on disdain.

## How does the algorithm limit people's self-expression?

By placing them into increasingly niche groups and reinforcing their participation in these groups.

> In the past, let's say in the '80s, '70s, if you were a goth, that was counterculture, right? It was a broad label. You could be a lot of different things if you were a goth. Now you have to be a cyber goth or a trad goth or a retro goth or a pastel goth. And now that you're in this smaller, perhaps, category, circularly forming your identity around this, because every time you get a pastel goth video, you're like, "Ooh, the algorithm really knows me," forgetting that the algorithm gave you that identity. Now you circularly identify with this smaller category of what you can be, which potentially limits your true self-expression, because if you were just a broad goth, that contains way of a wider semantic range.

When you show the algorithm that you contain multitudes, it won't recommend you anything to further broaden your interests. Instead, it will find the most controversial among your interests and suggest content that satisfies them, burying you ever deeper into that slump with every click.

## What should a group do to convince the masses of the merits of their ideas? 

The Democratic Party is especially bad about this. Adam Aleksic says it's because they don't understand how to communicate in the information age.

> Start thinking about how to Trojan horse through ideas. There's always gonna be a group that doesn't want to hear your ideas. You need to push it through by packaging it inside a carrier meme that is more funny or more compelling.

In the information age, we communicate through memes, and the most effective way of convincing people is through humor. Because Republicans have abandoned a coercive means to spread their message (fear) and adopted something different (memes) doesn't automatically make the latter coercive. Learn from the Republicans.
