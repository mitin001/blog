## How to manage a PR crisis?

Acknowledge the problem, let the leader demonstrate their leadership skills, and over-correct.

> There are only three things you have to remember in crisis management, but they're really difficult to do. One, you acknowledge the problem, right? This happened, this was terrible. It happened with our product. Two, the top guy or gal has to be out in front. And one of the reasons Exxon got in so much trouble with the Valdez was the CEO couldn't be found. And then the third thing and the hardest thing to do is to over-correct.

When Johnson & Johnson learned that their product was laced with cyanide on the shelves of a supermarket, they didn't tell the public that the incident was contained and that they could continue buying Tylenol without a worry.

> The temptation is to under-correct and not get in the way of your business. No, no, no, you clear all shelves.
