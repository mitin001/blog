Like any other episode of [Необъяснимо, но факт](../../../2025/10/27/nnf.md), this film is a collection of fragments of other films mixed with original footage. I tried using the reverse image search engines Google, Yandex, TinEye, and Bing on a set of frames extracted from the film to tell which footage was original and which was sourced from elsewhere.

A person's soul walks through the portal to the afterlife. To cross over, he must go through a wall of water. Another soul is turned away, so he must go back into the land of the living. Presumably, he was saved on the operating table.

There is a frame in this film (03_07.560 frame=4689) that displays the face page of a passport of a Russian citizen from Moscow. The following personally identifiable information is visible: the full name, date of birth, place of birth, the face, the signature, the passport number, where it was issued, and the date of issue.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/writecomments.com/nnf/001/2/00_04_18.360 frame=6459.jpg" height=150>

The same person is then shown wearing a [cross necklace] along with what appears to be a [Chinese numismatic charm], which is closely associated with magic. [Christianity and magic are conflicting ideologies], so wearing both of those necklaces at the same time and having them rub against one another may be viewed as controversial.

The host is shown using a computer. On the computer, there is a Word document that begins with the phrase he said at the beginning of the segment: "У меня в руках диск..." Another Word document is titled "Вячеслав", presumably for Вячеслав Климов, the person discussed above. Interestingly, the current keyboard layout is EN, not RU, which suggests that maybe the last thing someone typed into this machine was in English or perhaps Latin script.

## What do we find if we search the Internet for the frames from *Необъяснимо, но факт: 1. В объятиях смерти*?

Found by TinEye to be [the 12th thumbnail frame for NNF chosen by NTVMIR], which appears on [NTVMIR's page for NNF]. The frame is in the sequence with frames from *Необъяснимо, но факт: 2. Кыштымский пришелец*, suggesting that the footage from the same source was reused in the second episode of this series.

Found by [Milvus] to match a frame from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38hmHXrh2MU, *National Geographic: The Incredible Human Body (2002)*.

Found by Yandex to be similar to the thumbnail for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fBrNTY8dbU, which is a frame from *Metropolis (1927)*. Both Metropolis and this film show a clock face and inner gears, suggesting that Metropolis may have served as an inspiration for this film or the original footage of the clock.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/writecomments.com/nnf/001/1/00_57.560 frame=1439.jpg" height=150>

This frame clearly displays the text "Янтарь" on the face of a clock between the hour labels 10 and 2 at the top of the clock and under the hour label 12 in the center.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/writecomments.com/nnf/001/2/03_58.080 frame=5952.jpg" height=150>

This frame displays the text "4 камня" on the face of the same clock between the hour labels 4 and 8 at the bottom of the clock and above the hour label 6 in the center. A Google search for "Янтарь 4 камня" turns up many alarm clock models that are similar or the same with the one shown in this film. A Google search for "Jantar 4 jewels" turns up the English-language version of the same alarm clock.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/writecomments.com/nnf/001/2/08_38.160 frame=12954.jpg" height=150>

A Google search for "Yantar alarm clock inner gears" turns up the components that are similar or the same to the ones shown in this frame.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/writecomments.com/nnf/001/2/08_37.680 frame=12942.jpg" height=150>

The inner-gear footage was not cut precisely from the source. This is a stray frame, not meant to be included in the film.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/writecomments.com/nnf/001/2/08_38.160 frame=12954.jpg" height=150>

This frame shows a flat metal clock spring, indicating that the footage displays a wind-up alarm clock. [Airedale Springs defines a clock spring]:

> Clock springs (also known as power springs) consist of a flat, pre-stressed strip of metal or other spring material, which is wound tightly around an axle (known as an arbour) and into a securing ring.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/writecomments.com/nnf/001/3/13_02.600 frame=19565.jpg" height=150>

Found by TinEye to match the thumbnail to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBOLm5Pvgrw, a video showing fragments of a National Geographic documentary that similarly connects the Tunguska event to nuclear tests. The video uses a track from the Gregorian album *The Dark Side* as background music, something we also hear in *Необъяснимо, но факт: 64. Ведьмы*. It's possible that the source footage for the Tunguska event was the same as the source footage for the nuclear blasts shown in the same footage reel in this film, which could've been this National Geographic documentary, a different documentary, or an amateur edit of fragments from them circulating the Internet around 2004-2005, which is where this series might also be getting its background music.

The account that posted the video, https://web.archive.org/web/20190312215548/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM-kjdrQge9AACfB3MSRyrg, appears to have been specializing in improving documentary footage (correcting the aspect ratio, reducing the hiss, etc) and posting regularly (e.g., one video a day). However, according to https://filmot.com/channel/UCM-kjdrQge9AACfB3MSRyrg, the account was terminated due to "multiple third-party claims of copyright infringement".

The footage was used in this film to depict an explosion that could be produced by the Tunguska asteroid hitting the Earth's surface.

Бессмертие*. In https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1051109,00.html, the reviewer notes the symbolism of water in the context of life and death:

> Have you noticed how many movies in recent years begin with shots of water, either from the surface or underneath? The epigraph of Ten Minutes Older is Marcus Aurelius's 'Time is a river' and it begins, and links each segment, with images of water. ... Has it something to do with the oceanic sense or the pull of amniotic fluids? Or sensations of memory, dreaming, being born, dying?

## Does the film *Необъяснимо, но факт: 1. В объятиях смерти* fairly describe what it depicts?

No, it mixes original and archival footage to tell unbelievable and often untrue stories. Some archival footage can be traced to its source, where the description of what it depicts will often stray significantly from its description in the [voiceover] of the film.

> Это произошло 30 июня 1908 года в глухой сибирской тайге в районе реки Подкаменная Тунгуска. Рано утром в 7 часов 15 минут по небу пролетел огненный шар болид. Его наблюдали многие жители восточной Сибири. Полет этого необычного небесного тела сопровождался звуком, напоминавшим раскаты грома. Взрыв вызвал сотрясение почвы, которое ощущалось на площади свыше 1000 квадратных километров между Енисеем, Леной и Байкалом. Через несколько лет причину катастрофы обнародовали. В тайгу упал огромный метеорит, названный Тунгусским. Лес в месте падения был повален веером от центра, причем в центре часть деревьев осталась стоять на корню, но без ветвей.

Translation:

> It happened on June 30, 1908, in the remote Siberian taiga near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River. Early in the morning, at 7:15 a.m., a fireball flew across the sky. It was observed by many residents of eastern Siberia. The flight of this unusual celestial body was accompanied by a sound resembling thunder. The explosion caused a ground shock that was felt over an area of more than 1,000 square kilometers between the Yenisei, Lena, and Baikal rivers. A few years later, the cause of the disaster was made public. A huge meteorite, named Tunguska, fell into the taiga. The forest at the site of the fall was knocked down in a fan shape from the center, with some trees in the center remaining standing but without branches.

These frames were also in *National Geographic: Asteroids: Deadly Impact (1997)*.

Described by *[Asteroids: Deadly Impact]*:

> Planet Earth not nearly as safe as we always assumed. It's like being in a hail of bullets going by all the time. They are bullets. They're bullets out there in space. These things have hit the Earth in the past. They will hit the Earth in the future. It will produce a catastrophe that exceeds all other known natural disasters by a large measure.

Described by *[Asteroids: Deadly Impact]*:

> This fireball was seen by thousands of people along the eastern seaboard in 1992. Many were attending high school football games and some had brought their video cameras. A piece of the meteorite touched down in Peekskill, New York, and cratered Michelle Knapp's 1980 Chevy Malibu.

Described by *[Asteroids: Deadly Impact]*:

> What was it then that violently shook the Earth on June 30th, 1908? A blinding fireball exploded over a remote part of Siberia. As far away as England, an eerie glow lit up the sky. Two decades passed before scientists could mount an expedition to find the site where the blast occurred. It was an arduous trip to an uncertain destination, but the scientists knew they had arrived when they saw the staggering devastation on the banks of the Tunguska River. Over hundreds of square miles, the forest life flattened in vast concentric circles.

Described by *[Asteroids: Deadly Impact]*:

> Meteor crater could not in fact be a meteor crater. ... A new mechanism by which craters could be made. ... Nuclear crater.
