This episode of [Pivot] answered my three burning questions of the day.

## Is the political right more toxic than the political left?

Yes, the reactions to the Charlie Kirk shooting showed us that the leaders on the right are not afraid to echo the worst, most toxic trolls among their followers.

> I haven't seen any famous person from the left who has any credibility saying anything but, _our hearts go out to the family, violence is not the answer, this needs to stop_. And then you have very famous right-wing hosts saying, _this is it, this is war, and it's the radical left._

## What motivates mass shooters and political assassins?

Social isolation, radicalization, and easy access to weapons.

> Typically they're young men who are hoping to regain social capital with what they see as a heroic act of violence. They're, you know, isolated and feel like people don't respect them, are looking to gain back social capital and think they can get it because they've been convinced this person or this movement is truly demonic and that they would be heroic in killing this person. And, oh, by the way, dad's got a sniper rifle.

## Is the AI bubble about to burst?

OpenAI, the leader in AI, thinks not. The growth projections they use in borrowing money forecast at least a six-fold expansion of this already massively overvalued company.

> OpenAI has said, _we're going to pay Oracle $60 billion a year for compute despite the fact we are currently OpenAI only making 10 billion a year_. They are so confident in their growth that they've just committed to spend $60 billion a year on compute despite only currently making 10 billion.
