## What is privacy?

> Privacy is the capacity for you to control the information about yourself. So, privacy is not about hiding, although hiding can be one of the things you do with privacy. Privacy is controlling what information you want to release to whom you want to release it under what circumstances, etc.

That is, until Facebook allowed you to select who could see your content, there was no privacy on Facebook.

## Can you live through the information age without losing your privacy? 

It appears not. The digital world is not like the physical world. Privacy violations in the digital world are easy to commit. They are also easy to scale.

> In the physical world, privacy has always been quite hard to violate in a massive way. Itâ€™s not like you can have a person just standing at the window of 100,000 people.
