# [Pivot](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/174725): [8/12/2025. David Remnick](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=72196062cbf285a977510ef625d16874)

Long ago, I saw a viral video of a [comedienne] storming out of an interview. Then, I saw [another interview] that she stormed out of, in another viral video. The comedienne was Joan Rivers. She soon became an obsession of mine. I watched everything she was in, including the [Comedy Central Roast of Joan Rivers], which was hosted by another comedienne, Kathy Griffin. She, too, became an obsession of mine. Having gone through everything with Joan Rivers, I then turned my attention to finding and watching everything with Kathy Griffin. This included the 8/2/2022 episode of the [Pivot] podcast, which Kathy Griffin co-hosted with Kara Swisher. I listened to many episodes of Pivot since then, but the one with David Remnick particularly stuck with me because it answered my two burning questions of the day.

## How far has America descended into authoritarianism in the first few months of Trump's second term? 

Congress and the courts have become the mere extensions of President Trump, similar to how the parliament and judiciary exist [in name only] in kleptocratic dictatorships like Russia.

> Finally, we have a Congress that's completely in its majority obedient to a president who is, by instinct, an authoritarian, and a court that is suspect in many ways as well. So finally, political power can be influenced by and maybe limited by civil society.

However, the United States still has civil society, which is not used to institutions of power working against its interests.

> It's exactly what Russia does not have. Civil society has been all but crushed. In very, very limited corners of civil society still exists in today's Russia. It's infinitesimal. We still have that.

## What is next for America?

> The gradual and then accelerating erasure of civil society.

As more and more of Trump's critics get silenced, the last remaining beacon of hope for course correction away from authoritarian takeover will dim. As we're letting it happen, the civil society is getting crushed.

> If we keep squandering it, the picture will get worse and worse.
