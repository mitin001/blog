## Why does society engage in security theater?

Out of fear. Our leaders don't know what to do, so they keep us busy acting out our assigned roles to prevent a panic. A lot of epidemiological advice is giving people something to do so they can feel better about themselves. If you spend 20 seconds by the sink every time you wash your hands, that has no effect on the virus particles you're breathing in. But it could help you fight the virus in the sense that keeping busy reduces your levels of stress, and the stress hormone cortisol is a known immunosuppressant. There's real strength to the placebo effect, even if its purported benefits are imagined. People are less stressed when they have clearly defined roles to play, even if what they're doing is in the realm of the performative, not material. For example, checking a person's temperature before allowing them to enter a building during the first few years of COVID was theater.

> Security overkill. This includes not just the notion of “security theater,” but the many instances in which someone places a layer of security between me and my everyday activities with no apparent benefit. My bank, for instance, would surely argue that its many and various anti-fraud measures are valuable. But in truth, they are a) meant to protect the bank, not me; and b) cumbersome to the point of ridiculous. It’s gotten to where I can predict which credit-card charge will trigger the bank’s idiot algorithm and freeze my account because it didn’t like the zip code where I used the card.

To check the regulatory box, corporations, which care not in the least for your safety, will make you go through idiotic rituals and then insult your intelligence by trying to convince you that it's for your own good.
