## When in the history of sports did athletes begin doping?

The cyclists of the 1890s were the first to cheat in their sport this way.

> It was cycling that introduced the sports world to doping.

Doping happened by way of a slippery slope. Caffeine was one of the gateway drugs.

> The history of modern doping began with the cycling craze of the 1890s and the six-day races that lasted from Monday morning to Saturday night. Extra caffeine, peppermint, cocaine and strychnine were added to the ridersâ€™ black coffee. Brandy was added to tea. Cyclists were given nitroglycerine to ease breathing after sprints. This was a dangerous business, since these substances were doled out without medical supervision.
