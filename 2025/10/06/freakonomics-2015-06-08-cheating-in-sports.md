# [When to Rob a Bank]. 06-08. Is Cheating Good for Sports?

This section of the last [Freakonomics] volume answered a question about doping but also got me thinking and made me realize I could answer a question about porn addiction.

## Should doping be allowed in sports? 

If we only consider the spectacle aspect of it, then yes.

> This is just how we like it. As much as we profess to like the games for the games’ sake, perhaps cheating is part of the appeal, a natural extension of sport that people condemn on moral grounds but secretly embrace as what makes sports most compelling. For all the talk of how cheating “destroys the integrity of the game,” maybe that’s not true at all? Perhaps cheating actually adds a layer of interest—a cat-and-mouse element, a detective-story element—that complements the game? Or maybe cheating is just another facet of the win-at-all-costs drive that makes a great athlete great? As the famous sports adage goes: “If you’re not cheating, you’re not trying.”

We allow porn performers to take viagra, so why not allow a bodybuilder take steroids? We watch both porn and sports for the same reason: to see the limits of human performance. It allows us to experience something we wouldn't dare push our bodies to do. If drugs can push those limits even further, the fantasy is even more fantastical. 

## Why do men get addicted to porn?

Because for many, it's better than sex. Some men see themselves as unattractive or too awkward to pursue their romantic life. For others, their bodies have given up on them every time they tried to experience sex in the real world. With porn, they get to experience a fulfilling sexual experience through the performers. If someone was bad at football in high school but always wanted to experience the joy of scoring, he would watch football for the rest of his life, imagining himself as those all-star athletes. It's like that with sex, too.
