This section of the last [Freakonomics] volume answered a question about cheating I didn't even know I had.

## What is ticketless travel insurance?

It's when you pay someone premiums so when you're caught by a ticket taker to be traveling without a ticket, the insurance will cover the cost of the fine. Ticketless travel insurance is not needed in countries like Austria where there are no ticket takers. An Austrian ticket taker is an oxymoron. No one even checks train tickets there because in Austrian culture, asking whether someone riding a train has actually paid for it is considered to be an insult. Elsewhere in the world, though, ticket takers are well worth what they are paid.

> Ganesh Kulkarni discovered that the commuter trains of Mumbai serve six million passengers daily but the system isn’t equipped to check everyone’s ticket. Instead, Kulkarni writes, ticket agents conduct random ticket checks. This has given rise to a form of cheating that is elegantly called “ticketless travel.” Although it’s probably not very common to get busted for traveling ticketlessly, there is a significant fine if you are. And so, Kulkarni writes, one clever traveler has devised an insurance policy to make sure that ticketless travelers who are caught can lay off some of the expense. Here’s how it works. You pay five hundred rupees (about eleven dollars) to join an organization of fellow ticketless travelers. If you do get caught traveling without a ticket, you pay the fine and turn in your receipt to the ticketless-traveler organization, which refunds you 100 percent of the fine. Don’t you wish that everyone in society was as creative as the cheaters?

Corruption seems to run so rampant in India that entire cottage industries built around ticket piracy spring up. I wouldn't be surprised if there's some sort of a bribery scheme between ticketless travel insurers and the train system employees.
