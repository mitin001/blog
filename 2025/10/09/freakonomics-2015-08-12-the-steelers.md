# 08-12. Ten Reasons to Like the Pittsburgh Steelers

This section of the book *[When to Rob a Bank (2015)](../../../2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md)* answered a question about sports fans.

## How would a sports fan argue about the superiority of his team?

Probably with a great deal of irony since most don't choose their team. The team chooses _them_ based on where they live. For example, prior to a football game between the Steelers and the Cardinals, a Steelers fan makes a case for why his team is superior to their opposing team by pointing out their winning streak, but not without also acknowledging their prior losing streak.

> While the Steelers are attempting to win their record sixth Super Bowl, they were for the first forty years of their existence almost incomparably bad. So whether you gravitate toward prolific winners or lovable losers, the Steelers can satisfy your needs.

Also, the Steelers are aptly named. The Cardinals are not.

> The Steelers are one of the few pro sports teams named after what their respective cities actually do or did. Pittsburgh made steel just as Green Bay packed meat; the cardinal, meanwhile, is a perfectly nice bird, but it doesn’t do squat for Arizona (nor did it previously for St. Louis). Furthermore, the Steelers’ logo isn’t a cartoonish bird or patronizingly noble “redskin”; it is the actual mark of steelmaking—a trio of red, blue, and yellow hypocycloids in a black circle.
