# 07-08. Hey Baby, Is That a Prius You’re Driving?

This section of the book *[When to Rob a Bank (2015)](../../../2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md)* answered a two questions about performative environmentalism.

## What is conspicuous conservation? 

The "right-minded cousin" of conspicuous consumption.

> Whereas conspicuous consumption is meant to signal how much green you’ve got, conspicuous conservation signals how green you are. Like carrying that “I’m not a plastic bag” bag, or installing solar panels on the side of your house facing the street—even if that happens to be the shady side.

People practicing conspicuous consumption show off how rich they are by surrounding themselves with expensive stuff. People practicing conspicuous conservation show off how good they are in much the same way, except their expensive stuff must call attention to the good cause.

## How much of environmentalism is performative environmentalism?

Too much, as found by the cited study, where this was the research question.

> How much value do people who lean green place on being seen leaning green?

Environmentally friendly products must help their users show off their environmental friendliness. Otherwise, they wouldn't be as effective.

> If the Prius looked like a Toyota Camry or a Toyota Corolla, it wouldn’t be as popular as it is.
