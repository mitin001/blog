# 09-01. When to Rob a Bank

This section of the book *[When to Rob a Bank (2015)](../../../2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md)* answered a question about bank robberies.

## What would the risk-benefit analysis of bank robbery look like?

It would quantify the risk of getting caught by the police and put it against the average amount stolen across all successful bank robberies. If you are entering the job market and considering the profession of a bank robber, it's not all that the movies make it out to be.

> As a profitable occupation, bank robbery leaves a lot to be desired.

The pay is shit, especially considering the risk of encountering the occupational hazards, i.e., the police.

> U.S. bank robbers earn an average of $4,120 when they are successful. But they arenâ€™t successful as often as I would have thought: they are arrested 35 percent of the time.
