# 10-03. More Sex Please, We’re Economists

This section of the book *[When to Rob a Bank (2015)](../../../2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md)* defined incentives in terms of deterring people from acting in their self-interest.

## What is an incentive? 

It is a way to deter people from acting in the interest of their personal welfare and instead pushing them toward contributing to the greater good. For example, punishment is a negative incentive that's supposed to deter people from committing crimes for their own self-interest and to the detriment of everyone else. The less crime, the safer the world for everyone else.

> We think that professional thieves should give up some aspects of their personal welfare (i.e., their thievery) for the greater good, and we convince them to do that with the prospect of prison terms.

If we let people act solely in their own self-interest, then no one will be able to get what they want. The price system is the best system of incentives that's ever been invented, judging by the success and the economic prosperity generated in the competitive marketplace.

> Our personal welfare is almost always in conflict with the greater good. When something exciting happens at the ballpark, everyone stands up to see better, and therefore nobody succeeds. At parties, everyone speaks loudly to be heard over everyone else, and therefore everyone goes home with a sore throat. The one great exception is the interaction among buyers and sellers in a competitive marketplace, where—for fairly subtle reasons—the price system aligns private and public interests perfectly.

When taking about the greater good in the context of sex positivity, we should incentivize people who practice safe sex to have more casual sex and disincentivize STI carriers from having casual sex.

> If you are a recklessly promiscuous person with a high probability of HIV infection, you pollute the partner pool every time you jump into it—and you should be discouraged, just as any polluter should be discouraged. But the flip side of that is that if you are a very cautious person with a low probability of infection—and a low propensity to pass on any infection that you do have—then you improve the quality of the partner pool every time you jump into it. That’s the opposite of pollution, and it should be encouraged for exactly the same reasons that pollution should be discouraged.
