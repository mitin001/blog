## Why is one individual's obesity a concern of the public at large?

Because obesity doesn't just threaten the health and safety of the individuals experiencing it. Obesity is also a public safety concern. Obese people threaten the structural integrity of buildings and vessels.

> A tour boat carrying forty-seven elderly passengers sank on Lake George in upstate New York, and twenty of them died. According to a National Transportation Safety Board report, this happened because the boat was badly overweight: the tour company used outdated passenger-weight standards to determine how many passengers the boat could safely carry. It wasn’t over the passenger limit, but it was very much over the weight limit. And when the tourists crowded to one side of the boat to take in the view, disaster struck. According to The New York Times, the tour company had been using the old standard of 140 pounds per passenger, which the NTSB had already warned was no longer valid, and which Governor George Pataki has now updated for New York State, setting the new average-passenger weight at 174 pounds.

Because Americans are getting progressively heavier, they should no longer rely on headcounts to determine if the structure they're going to enter can safely withstand their weight. A 34-pound increase in the average weight in such a short time is an alarming trend. Americans, stop eating yourselves into ruin.
