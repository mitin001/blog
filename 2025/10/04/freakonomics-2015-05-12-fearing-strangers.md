## If you're investigating a violent crime, where should you start looking for the offender?

In the victim's address book. There's a good chance you'll find the perpetrator there, especially if the victim is female. Also, the more severe the crime, the likelier it is that the victim knew the offender.

> In general, we fear strangers way more than we should. Consider a few supporting pieces of evidence: 1. In the U.S., the proportion of murder victims who knew their assailants to victims killed by strangers is about 3 to 1. 2. Sixty-four percent of women who are raped know their attackers; and 61 percent of female victims of aggravated assault know their attackers. (Men, on the other hand, are more likely to be assaulted by a stranger.)

## Is the world scarier than we think? 

No, the world is less scary than we think. People fear the outside world more than they should.

> It probably has to do with the heuristics—the shortcut guesses—our brains use to solve problems, and the fact that these heuristics rely on the information already stored in our memories. And what gets stored away? Anomalies—the big, rare, “black swan” events that are so dramatic, so unpredictable, and perhaps world-changing, that they imprint themselves on our memories and con us into thinking of them as typical, or at least likely, whereas in fact they are extraordinarily rare.
