## Why is our society so interested in the true crime genre?

Our society has an appetite for crime because we're living through a period of heightened cynicism, as pointed out by some but also doubted by others.

> Are we too cynical? I don’t think so, but some people do. We routinely hear from readers who say it’s a shame that we’ve called attention to so much deceit, trickery, and cheating.

If our society is driven to stories about con artists and all other kinds of criminals, surely it indicates that we live in a cynical society. And yet, the freakonomists say that the criticisms they receive from the portion of society protesting its descent into cynicism are unfounded.

> Hey, we also called attention to people who don’t cheat.

Freakonomics is not cynical only by the standards set by the booming (and exploitative) true crime genre and murder porn. So Freakonomics is not cynical only in comparison to what it stands next to.
