# [Vocabulary terms for the less obvious harassment tactics used against women online](https://x.com/femfreq/status/525350371125100545)

This post was referenced by [a blog post made by the artist who coined the term sealioning](https://wondermark.com/sea-lion-verb/), which, in turn, was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on sealioning](../../../2025/10/20/wikipedia-sealioning.md). It answered a question about countering bad-faith debate tactics.

## What to do if someone is firehosing you with questions or statements you are expected to correct? 

Pick the weakest one and address that and only that. If the person asks to address the rest, tell him you just assumed he was gish galloping (because he went out of his way to make that impression on you, given the volume of his post), and all the other statements are just rewordings of the one you already addressed.

> Gish galloping - flooding the debate space with an overload of minor, often reworded, issues.

If the person keeps asking questions and accusing you of weaseling out of civil debate, counter by saying that you simply need to rest. Who can argue with a physical need?

> Sea lioning - pestering a target with unsolicited questions delivered with a false air of civility.
