# [The Russian "Firehose of Falsehood" Propaganda Model](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html)

This article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article about the firehouse of falsehood](../../../2025/10/24/wikipedia_firehose_of_falsehood.md). It answered three questions about malicious information workers: trolls and propagandists.

## How much does a professional writer need to write per day to sustain gainful employment? 

If one is employed as a Russian propaganda troll, at least 27,000 characters across 135 short comments (but longer than a tweet), with about 11 comments per hour, i.e., one comment about every 5 minutes.

> The trolls are on duty 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, and each has a daily quota of 135 posted comments of at least 200 characters.

## What determines when someone will seek information on Reddit vs. an expert? 

How much information is readily available on the subject at hand. Experts are sought when information is scarce, and Reddit is there to help parse through the information when it's abundant.

> When information volume is low, recipients tend to favor experts, but when information volume is high, recipients tend to favor information from other users.

We consult experts on niche topics. If I need to identify an exact species of an mushroom encountered in the wild, I will take a picture and do a reverse-image search on it, which is how I will find mycologists who have encountered a similar or the same species. That's who I will trust to identify the species. However, if I need general guidance on foraging for mushrooms, something for which there are hundreds of guides, I would rather read foraging Reddit threads instead. Those will give me the insights of the people who have gone through the foraging experience themselves, not just what the experts think non-experts would want to know. We want to cut through the noise to get at the information most relevant to us. Unfortunately, that's exactly where present-day propagandists plant their trolls. They will overrun your favorite forum with falsehoods that could harm you, and sometimes, you won't even know which claim was made by a troll and which was made by a legitimate user.

> High volume can consume the attention and other available bandwidth of potential audiences, drowning out competing messages.

## What allows Russian propagandists to be so rapid?

Because they just make things up to make current events fit their narrative. They didn't need to spend time on fact-finding or fact-checking.

> Contemporary Russian propaganda is continuous and very responsive to events. Due to their lack of commitment to objective reality, ... Russian propagandists do not need to wait to check facts or verify claims; they just disseminate an interpretation of emergent events that appears to best favor their themes and objectives. This allows them to be remarkably responsive and nimble, often broadcasting the first “news” of events (and, with similar frequency, the first news of nonevents, or things that have not actually happened).

The Russian propagandists are rapid because they have to be. This is what gives them an edge in the minds of their targets. People remember the first thing they learned about an event.

> Russian propaganda has the agility to be first, which affords propagandists the opportunity to create the first impression. Then, the combination of high-volume, multichannel, and continuous messaging makes Russian themes more likely to be familiar to their audiences, which gives them a boost in terms of perceived credibility, expertise, and trustworthiness.

Not only do people better remember their first impression about an event, but they also give it priority when confronted with more information about it. We are susceptible to confirmation bias. If the new information doesn't confirm what we've already learned from the propaganda, we discard it. This is how people end up in information bubbles where their understanding of the world is exactly opposite of the truth.

> First impressions are very resilient: An individual is more likely to accept the first information received on a topic and then favor this information when faced with conflicting messages. Furthermore, repetition leads to familiarity, and familiarity leads to acceptance.

Agility works in favor of the propagandists. If they can concoct the propaganda in response to an event quickly, they give themselves a wider window of time during which to reinforce their message.

> When processing information, consumers may save time and energy by using a frequency heuristic, that is, favoring information they have heard more frequently.

Propaganda production must be fast to be effective. It must be churned out in great volumes so it can truly overwhelm its targets, to the point where they stop analyzing information and start simply accepting everything as fact.

> Information overload leads people to take shortcuts in determining the trustworthiness of messages.
