This article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article about the firehouse of falsehood](../../../2025/10/24/wikipedia_firehose_of_falsehood.md). It answered a question about the motives of the Russian government behind the anti-5G propaganda it disseminates in the West.

## Why are Russian propagandists trying to make the Americans scared of 5G?

So the Americans would demand the government put a stop to the development of the infrastructure for this technology. This way, Russia, where the development of 5G is in full swing, can get ahead.

> The Kremlin would really enjoy getting democratic governments tied up in fights over 5G’s environmental and health hazards.
