# 15. Unlock The Power of Your Influence

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered a question about motivation and showed me that I can answer a question about comforting a grieving person.

## How to motivate people?

Motivation is tricky because it's about finding the fine line between trying to control other people (impossible) and getting them to change their behavior indirectly (hard). You can only control your own behavior, not theirs, so you must find the way to behave in such a way that will influence others.

> Stop pressuring them to change. Accept that you can’t control their behavior or actions. Adults only do what they feel like doing. Your job is to accept them for who they are and where they are. Let Them be.

To motivate people effectively, simply let them be as they are and reclaim the energy you would've spent trying to control them into modeling the behavior you want from them in yourself.

> When you stop trying to pressure people to change and Let Them be, something magical happens. You now have time and energy to unlock the power of your positive influence. People are social creatures that are highly influenced and inspired by the people around them.

Set a positive example for other people. They might just follow it.

> Adults only do what they feel like doing. Your power is in your positive influence.

A lot of human behavior is emulation. Just show them that your behavior is worth it for them to emulate, and they likely will.

> When you see someone online gushing about a protein powder, or a new style of jeans, or a pro golfer holding up a club that “improved their golf game,” you suddenly feel yourself wanting to buy it. If you see something working positively for someone else, it often makes you feel interested in it too. Whether you realize it’s happening or not, when someone else is either having a lot of fun, or getting the results you want, or making something look easy and pleasurable, you are hardwired to move toward it. It’s why when you hear a friend raving about a book, you naturally want to read it.

Use the power of social contagion. That's how changes in behavior propagate through society.

> People’s behavior is contagious.

Make the action you want people to take look easy.

> Model the behavior change you want to see and walk the talk you’ve been asking for. If you have ANY shot at influencing them to move toward the behavior or change you want them to make, you need to show them how easy it is.

Even when people follow your formula to find success, the whole time they're doing it they're convinced it was all their idea. Setting an example is key to motivation.

> It’s a sneaky way to get someone else to change and believe it was their idea.

When you watch other people leave work to go on walks, you'll start noticing the desire to do so building up in yourself. That's where motivation is coming from: yourself. All other people can do is show you what the right action was for them, and you'll wonder if it's right for you, too.

> As you head out the door for your walk, you think this was your idea. Nope. It was the influence of your co-worker working its magic on your brain. And they weren’t even trying to do so! They were just going for a walk and enjoying it. Makes sense, doesn’t it? That’s the power of your influence.

When a person you're trying to influence wants to talk, use motivational interviewing. Ask questions that pertain to the behavior you want them to change in themselves, but don't inject any pressure.

> “How are you feeling about your health right now?”

The person who's struggling to find the motivation to change their behavior will feel the tension from the question alone, and if you haven't injected any pressure into it, they won't blame you for it.

> The question invites someone to really experience the tension between how they truly feel about where they are, and the fact that they are not doing anything about it.

To share your feelings about the answer is to inject pressure into the conversation. Simply let them talk. Every time they pause to let you speak, simply ask another question.

> No matter what their answer to the first question is, you’re not going to share your feelings about it. You’re just going to repeat back their answer: “So it sounds like. . .” So it sounds like you’re feeling okay about your health? If they answer in a one-word response—“Okay”—no problem. Just turn it into another open-ended question. What makes you feel okay about it? And then continue to just listen with curiosity and acceptance, and respond only with open-ended questions that repeat back what they just said. It sounds like you’re okay with your health because you’ve been this way for a long time.

Mel Robbins shares a question bank you can reach into if you're struggling to come up with the motivational interviewing questions on your own.

> How do you feel about that? So it sounds like you’ve gotten used to it. I mean, you’re saying you’re comfortable. It almost feels a little bit more to me like resignation. Do you feel like it’s going to take too much work to change? What feels hard about it? It must be incredibly frustrating to have me nagging you all the time, expecting more of you. Can you tell me a little bit about how long you’ve felt that way? So I hear you saying that you don’t need me to do anything?

Motivational interviewing ends the moment you start offering your feelings because the feeling the tension urging the person to change their behavior will find the outlet will instantly be replaced with the struggle to regain control, to wrestle it away from you.

> You are just asking questions. Your opinions are irrelevant and they are not for this conversation. The second you offer one, you’ll be pressuring the person and it will kill the effectiveness of this technique. This technique has been proven in research and clinical settings to be very effective in getting people to admit to themselves that there is a big disconnect between what they actually want and what their current behavior is. And that is your goal: to make them feel the tension between these things. I have to emphasize: Do not get discouraged if all you get is one word answers, or they keep trying to change the subject. The point of this technique is not to get them to tell you the truth. It’s to create discomfort that they feel internally. They may not express it to you. That tension is critical, because it ultimately becomes the source of their motivation to change. Seeing the disconnect between what they want and their current actions is what pushes them to eventually change for themselves. That’s why you can’t insert yourself. You are just a vehicle for getting them to experience the disconnect, and you are doing it in a way that is loving, compassionate, and curious. You just want to know how they feel about this topic. This conversation is a critical component for awakening their motivation to change. So Let Them talk. And Let Me listen.

To get yourself to stop pressuring other people or sharing how you feel about their inability to act quickly enough, be honest with yourself. Understand why you so desperately want this person to change their behavior.

> This is about you getting to the root cause of your frustration, and it will always have to do with their behavior making you feel a loss of control. Allow yourself to be honest. When you see that it’s been about YOU all along, and your need to control, it is easier to drop the pressure and Let Them be.

## Why is it a bad idea to say to a grieving person that you know how it feels?

You will be met with indignance. Don't try to justify that you know how it feels by recounting a painful experience from your life. It'll be meet with, "How dare you?" It'll make you relive your own painful experiences, and you will be stumped on by a person who, at this moment, doesn't know any better. Just let them be.  "It looks as if I'm just making it worse when I speak, so I'll just sit quietly with you." The excessiveness of the indignance that will come your way is exactly why everyone will tell you not to ever compare anyone's grief to your own to the grieving person.
