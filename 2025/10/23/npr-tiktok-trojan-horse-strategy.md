# [TikTokâ€™s Trojan Horse Strategy](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5582749)

This episode of [Planet Money](../../../2025/10/23/planet-money.md) answered a question about brand strategy.

## Why have tech products become so disarmingly sunny in their brand and content?

That's how brands signal to your subconscious that their product is safe, especially when it isn't. For example, the propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party, TikTok, hired sound designers to create the sound identity for the platform that communicated to the user that the platform was safe to use, its owner notwithstanding.

> It was really important that the sound expressed this kind of welcoming nature and the sense of almost safety on the platform.

Similarly, LLMs that drive teenagers to suicide will infuriate you with their bumbling positivity.

> There's a fine line between sunny and irritating.
