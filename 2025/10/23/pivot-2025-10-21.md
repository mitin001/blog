This episode of [Pivot](../../../2025/10/14/pivot.md) answered a question about yet another advantage big tech firms have over everyone else.

## Why do big tech firms get so many government subsidies?

Because when you're a big firm, all money trickles down to you. For example, when a data center is built, the area around it will get higher electricity costs.

> They are so power-hungry that you are gonna see 50, 100, 200, 300% increases in electricity costs in these areas.

People living next to data centers will quickly begin demanding government subsidies for their electricity costs.

> These people will get outraged, so the government will step in and will subsidize the electricity costs of the grid, which is nothing but a transfer of wealth from taxpayers, especially people consuming electricity in those regions, to big tech firms.

These government subsidies will end up subsidizing the big tech firms.
