This article was referenced by [an article on online trolling](../../../2025/10/26/theguardian-how-to-handle-a-troll.md). It answered a question about the darker side of online trolling.

## After Jonathan Weisman criticized Trump, why did someone respond on Twitter calling him (((Weisman)))?

It was to identify him as a target of attack for alt-right bots.

> Jonathan Weisman, deputy Washington editor of the New York Times, described how it played out for him following the publication of his article on Donald Trump. A Twitter user triple bracketed him in a tweet, and he was subjected to a sudden hurricane of abuse, images of concentration camps and death threats.

Bracketing sometime is to point the firehouse of abuse on them.

> The brackets, known as “echoes”, are a far-right invention, to identify Jewish Twitter users, so that other antisemites can then attack them online.

The practice was subverted when Twitter users started bracketing themselves en-masse.

> It’s a bit like the urban legend about the Danish king wearing a yellow star during the occupation. As the myth has it, King Christian X wore a star in response to Nazi requests that he solve his “Jewish problem”, and all the Danish people followed suit, which led the identifier to become meaningless.
