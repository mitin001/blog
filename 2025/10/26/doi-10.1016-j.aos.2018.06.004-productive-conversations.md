# [The LAAPs that foster productive conversations and the crebit that undermines them](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aos.2018.06.004)

This academic paper was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on sealioning](../../../2025/10/20/wikipedia-sealioning.md). It answered five questions about social norms.

## How to find an audience in an already saturated market?

One way to differentiate yourself in a saturated market is willing to violate its norms in a way a subset of your clients will tolerate (or even cheer on). Exploitation films and TV programming are examples of that. Similarly, news outlets historically had journalistic standards that were too high, evidenced by the fact that when "news" outlets with lower standards emerged, they quickly found vast audiences.

> Buzzfeed and Gawker grew rapidly by relaxing sourcing standards, sacrificing faithfulness in order to provide news established outlets treated as crebit. Others have grown by setting standards that appeal to people who want news that supports their existing views.

Here, crebit refers to a violation of norms. The term comes from accounting where a failure to differentiate between credit and debit is a violation of accounting norms. Violating norms isn't always lucrative. In fact, it's likelier to backfire, so proceed with caution.

> Diplomacy is more important in fields that address issues more controversial than accounting, as demonstrated by scholars’ attempts to punish authors, editors and journals for statements comparing racial identity to gender identity.

## Is it necessary for an article submitted to a scholarly journal to include the vocabulary and theories of its field of study even when excluding those would still meaningfully contribute to it?

It is necessary for even the simplest ideas to be enveloped in the technical language and the framework baggage of the field. Not doing so would violate the norms of the discipline.

> A statement that doesn’t use the theories and methods of a paradigm is “not even wrong” and is thus excluded.

This article is a case in point. In order for an observation that _every community has norms and shuns those members who violate them_ to be published in a journal of accounting, the word "norms" had to be replaced with LAAPs (for similarity to the accounting term GAAPs), and the behavior that violates said norms had to be termed "crebit" (a mix of the words credit and debit, something people in accounting would be more familiar with than terms from sociology).

> I have called these norms _LAAPs_, and called the matters they exclude _crebit_ (since crebit is excluded from financial accounts).

The author justifies the existence of these words by giving them a narrower definition than "norms" and "shunning," as in the way communities shun those who violate said norms.

> The LAAP-crebit focuses on how norms exclude and punish speech in the service of productive conversation.

The author laments that papers in accounting journals extensively cite papers from other disciplines, but other disciplines don't cite papers from accounting journals in equal measure.

> We pay top dollar in the scholarly currency of citations to import theories from finance, economics, and psychology, so that our only value-generating activity is to document how those theories apply to accounting institutions. We have never turned a profit doing so, as measured by the small number of citations we garner from other disciplines.

The author's attempt to get other fields to pay attention to the accounting field was to invent the LAAP-crebit terminology.

## Why is it considered bad manners to talk about politics or religion at the dinner table?

Because these are divisive topics, and the purpose of a dinner-table conversation is to unite people.

> The ideal dinner party has a clear (if unstated) agenda of strengthening social bonds among attendees. The tight focus on a singular goal leads both venues to impose high thresholds for diplomacy, and thus rule out vast topics likely to cause offense.

## What is bragging? 

> Claiming credit for good outcomes while using intensifying language, and modesty as giving credit to others without intensifying language.

Bragging goes against the norms of society, evidenced by the strong negative response it elicits in almost any audience.

> Statements about who caused good outcomes risk undermining productive conversations about performance by threatening audience members’ status; bragging effectively says “I am better than you” to those who don’t identify closely with the speaker, and therefore do not share in their success.

It is okay (and expected) for a CEO to brag during conference calls because all of its attendees have a stake in his success.

> The LAAP for conference calls imposes a fairly low threshold for diplomacy, because barriers to attendance and their unengaging nature cause them to attract mostly analysts and active investors who care deeply about performance (and so care relatively less about status), and who are likely to identify reasonably closely with the CEO due to their frequently longstanding relationships and mutual dependence (each needs to stay in the good graces of the other to do their job well).

Injecting deceit into bragging makes it worse. Humblebragging is even more of a violation of the norms, as reported by the authors referenced by this article.

> They find much more negative responses to humblebragging regardless of venue, which they interpret as reflecting the perceived dishonesty of pretending to be humble while actually bragging.

The only audiences that tolerate humblebragging are those for which the sympathy for the speaker outweighs their disdain for his dishonesty.

> Statements are humblebrags when they pair a claim of credit with a claim that evokes sympathy. Those who identify exceptionally closely with the speaker will be able to feel sympathy while also sharing in reflected success, but this audience is probably limited to family and close friends.

## When asking a person for an opinion, how to prompt the person to be truthful and diplomatic?

Ask them to include both the pros and cons in their opinion. That's what Glassdoor does. This results in the reviewer investing more time in crafting their response, which hopefully leads them to be more truthful. Meanwhile, prompting them to think through the positive aspects of the subject of their opinion points them toward a more diplomatic direction.

> Glassdoor requires that reviewers offer both positive and negative views, which is likely to increase both the credibility and diplomacy of their reviews.
