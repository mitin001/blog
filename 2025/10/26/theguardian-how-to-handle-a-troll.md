This article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on sealioning](../../../2025/10/20/wikipedia-sealioning.md). It answered two questions about online trolling.

## What to do if a troll responds to your social media post? 

Take comfort in the fact that you've won the game of the Internet. Your post was deemed a meaningful contribution to the kind of discourse bad people don't want.

> Instead of taking offence, take heart: you’re poking at something someone really doesn’t want you to. Better yet, an increased awareness of state-sponsored trolls means users feel more confident calling out purported connections to troll factories publicly.

Call out a troll for others to see, and don't engage further. 

## What to do if a sea lion responds to your social media post?

It's tricky because once you've realized you're being sealioned, you've already engaged with this person or bot a fair amount. Simply find a high-quality source that would answer their endless questions and direct them there. If you've mistakenly misidentified someone's good-faith attempt to learn more about the subject, they'll check out the link. If this was indeed a sea lion, you've subverted their attack by putting a stop to it early. You're no longer sinking your time and energy into the unproductive conversation.

> A suspected sea lion may in fact just be a genuinely curious individual looking to learn more. So rather than ignoring them outright or devoting precious time to discussing the individual merits and drawbacks of a point with them, courteously directing them to a third-party resource – a couple of links to news stories about the matter at hand – can help nullify their attempts to derail your day. What to say: “Here’s a peer-reviewed, academically rigorous link explaining all the information you need. Have a great day!” *Block*
