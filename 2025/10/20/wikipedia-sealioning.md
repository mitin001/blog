This Wikipedia article was referenced by [Wikipedia's essay on bludgeoning](../../../2025/10/12/wikipedia-dont-bludgeon.md). It defined a disruptive practice masquerading as a good-faith attempt to have a civil discussion.

## What is sealioning? 

> A denial-of-service attack targeted at human beings (i.e. overloading a target with questions).

It's like hacking a discussion for the purposes of shutting it down. Sealioning exhausts the discussion participants. A metaphorical sea lion will overwhelm their target with questions. Initially, the target will respond to the questions, but the sea lion will generate more questions (sometimes with the help of an LLM), and eventually the target will drop out of the discussion in exhaustion, which the sea lion will claim to be a victory.
