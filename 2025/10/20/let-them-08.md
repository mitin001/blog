# 8. The Right Decision Often Feels Wrong

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered two questions about relationships. This chapter is [longer](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=4506b5ee94674f5fc3ebe298524b16cf) in the audio book.

## Should you stay in a relationship just because leaving would hurt the other person?

You should absolutely leave a relationship if the only thing keeping you together is your fear of how the other person will take it. You will be doing both yourself and the other person a favor by leaving.

> In life the most courageous, honorable, and kind thing to do is tell someone you don’t want to be with them. It’s hard to be honest, especially when other people are emotionally immature. You don’t want to deal with their guilt, venting, and bad moods, so you just avoid them. You’re not avoiding confrontation—you’re avoiding someone else’s emotions. The only conflict is the conflict you’re going to feel internally about how your decisions are going to impact other people emotionally and how they’re going to react.

Even though leaving such a relationship is the right thing to do, many people still prefer to stay.

> What seems logical on the surface doesn’t feel logical when you know it will cause other people a lot of pain. Too often in life, when you’re in that dilemma, you choose to inflict the pain on yourself instead of making a decision that you know is right for you but is going to be painful for other people to accept.

If you've been waiting for the Universe to give you a sign to leave you relationship, this is it, courtesy of Mel Robbins.

> Find the courage to do what you know is right for you, even though it's a hard decision to make. Because the fact is, once you make the decision, I promise you, you have everything you need to ride the wave. And every time you make the right decision, even though it feels wrong, you take responsibility for creating the life you deserve. And if you can't give yourself permission, let me. Your friend Mel is giving you the permission to make the hard decision.

If you're afraid to leave a relationship just because you're afraid to upset the other person, this is exactly the kind of a relationship you should leave. What other things are you denying yourself just to keep the other person quiet?

> You’re allowing other people’s emotional immaturity to have power over your life. You’re allowing somone else’s outbursts, guilt trips, and reactions to dictate your actions, leading you to constantly manage their emotions rather than focusing on your own. This means you’re always prioritizing the emotional needs of others at the expense of your own happiness.

Your life is for you. You deserve a relationship where you can be yourself and live without the fear of upsetting the other person with your decisions.

> Make the right decisions for you, even if they make other people upset. You maintain your power when you stop taking on the burden of others’ emotions and act in a way that aligns with your values.

## Should you keep a secret from someone because telling them the truth will upset them? 

It depends on what telling the truth will cost you. If it will ruin the relationship to the point where living with the secret would be preferable, then continue keeping the secret. However, if you are only afraid of the person's reaction, tell them the secret.

> If you understand that emotions are a normal part of life, and that adults are allowed to feel the ups and downs and can survive it, you would be more courageous. It’s not your job to protect everybody else from feeling emotions. Your job and responsibility is to live your life in a way that is aligned with your values, and in a way that gets you. Sometimes that’s going to hurt someone. It’s going to disappoint them. It’s going to cause pain or heartbreak knowing that your decision will hurt someone else.

Both you and the other person will survive their emotional reaction.

> You are stronger than anyone else’s emotional reaction. Let Them have their opinions. Let Them have their reactions. Let Me have mine. Let your emotions rise up and give yourself the space to process your emotions too. Never let someone else’s emotional reactions keep you from making the hard decision. Let Me be honest with myself and others. Let Me do the hard thing that is painful now, because it is the right thing to do and will save me from so much pain later. Let Me give myself the opportunity to have the life I deserve.

If the truth will come out later, the person may feel betrayed. Will you have a good reason for why you haven't told them the truth sooner? If so, live without fear because just as you would survive their emotions had you told them the truth yourself, you will also survive their emotions when the truth ultimately comes out on its own.
