# 9. Yes, Life Isn’t Fair

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered a question about jealousy.

## What to do when you start to feel jealous? 

Treat it as a learning opportunity. The subject of your jealousy is showing you what to do to get what you're coveting. Just follow their example; you now have a template for accomplishing what they've accomplished. If you're jealous precisely because you can't get what you want because you don't have their advantages, then understand that you have other advantages they don't have, and you can get things they can't get. Make use of every advantage you have in life. If you don't have many advantages, go find them. Make your own luck.

> The more time you spend staring at someone else, the more you miss the entire point of the game. In life, you’re not playing against anyone. You’re playing with them. Someone will always have better cards than yours. It’s not about the hand you’ve been dealt; it’s how you play it. And while you’ve been busy comparing yourself to everyone else, you’ve missed one of the greatest secrets in life: Other people teach you how to be a better player, and that’s how you win.

Mel says you can't change that other people may be luckier than you, but I disagree. You can lift yourself up to match their luck. Follow every opportunity that comes your way, shift between them often, and after a while. you will inevitably stumble into luck.
