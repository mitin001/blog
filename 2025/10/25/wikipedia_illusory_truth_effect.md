# [Illusory truth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_truth_effect)

This Wikipedia article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article about the firehouse of falsehood](../../../2025/10/24/wikipedia_firehose_of_falsehood.md). It answered two questions about cognitive biases.

## Why do people start to believe false claims once they are repeated enough times?

The illusory truth effect.

> The tendency to believe false information to be correct after repeated exposure.

An illusion of truth arises from us mistaking the memory-retrieval system of our brain for a credible source of information whereas it is simply a conduit of information.

> Information retrieved from memory is more fluent or familiar than when it was first learned and thus produces an illusion of truth.

We determine whether something is true based on whether it's like other statements we know to be true. We compare a potential truth to a known truth, and if they're aligned, then we conclude that the given statement is true. However, sometimes we conflate familiarity and truthfulness. If a statement is familiar, we will sometimes mistakenly conclude that the statement is in line with what we know to be true even when the truthfulness of the familiar statement has not been established. This is a vulnerability in the human reasoning ability, akin to hindsight bias or confirmation bias.

> When truth is assessed, people rely on whether the information is in line with their understanding or if it feels familiar. The first condition is logical, as people compare new information with what they already know to be true. Repetition makes statements easier to process relative to new, unrepeated statements, leading people to believe that the repeated conclusion is more truthful.

When you see the same true/false question across multiple standardized tests, every time you encounter it, you become more and more likely to answer "true." The confidence in your answer also grows. All this despite the fact that the test doesn't provide you any information on whether the statement is indeed true or false: that's what it asks you.

> When an individual hears something for a second or third time, their brain responds faster to it and misattributes that fluency as a signal for truth.

## Why do people continue believing myths even after learning that they've been debunked?

Because debunking a myth requires repeating it, and humans equate repetition with truthfulness. Even when one hears that something is a common misconception or a debunked myth, the message they take away is often the opposite. Simply mentioning a myth even in the context of debunking it reinforces belief in said myth.

> Repetitively hearing that a certain fact is wrong can paradoxically cause it to feel right.

Our minds operate heuristically. They take shortcuts and avoid any unnecessary processing. Sometimes, what they deem to be unnecessary processing is precisely what would've allowed the person to unlearn a falsehood.

> Familiarity can overpower rationality.

After hearing statement X, some time later followed by the statement "X is a myth," all we hear is the statement X. Our minds often don't take the time to determine that the two statements cancel each other out. Do not overestimate the extent of your audience's cognitive load. If there's a simple way to say something (e.g., a direct statement rather than a refutation of a myth), then make it simple.

> Subjective, tangential properties such as ease of processing can matter when people evaluate sourced information.
