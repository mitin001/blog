This article was referenced by [an article on firehosing](../../../2025/10/24/theguardian-firehosing.md). It answered a question about propaganda.

## Who is the target of propaganda?

Not individuals. The society at large is the target.

> Even clear falsehoods, repeated widely and frequently enough, could be effective in warping public opinion in the propagandistâ€™s favor.

A propagandist doesn't need to persuade individual members of a given society. He needs to overpower the society.
