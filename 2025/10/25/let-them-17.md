# 17. How to Provide Support the Right Way

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered a question about supporting someone going through hardship.

## What is the right way to support people hitting rock bottom?

Not enabling them by loaning them money, letting them live with you, etc. Simply cheer them on as they figure their own way out of the difficult situation.

> Rescuing people from their problems makes them drown in them. When you enable others with your money, words, and actions, you don’t foster their independence—you hinder their healing. You prolong their suffering, their debt, their breakdown, and in turn, your own. Truth: People only heal when they are ready to do the work. You will be ready for them to heal before they are. While your intentions may be good, constantly stepping in to solve their issues creates dependency and frustration, and hinders their ability to take responsibility for themselves. You cannot want someone’s healing more than they do.

Mel Robbins recounts the story of her husband Chris asking his brother for money when he hit rock bottom. When the brother refused, Chris finally decided to turn his life around.

> If his brother had loaned him the money, it would have just prolonged this devastating situation. When his brother said no, he had no choice but to rescue himself. That’s rock bottom and it changes your life for the better. Because, when you finally hit it, you connect with something solid inside yourself—the resolve to change. It’s important to point out that Chris’s brother said no to money, but that doesn’t mean he wasn’t supportive. He listened to Chris, he validated his feelings, he felt a lot of compassion for him, and ultimately, by refusing to loan him money, he was saying, “I believe in your ability to figure this out.”

Note that the brother didn't turn his back on Chris. He remained a cheerleader for his brother's success. He just wasn't willing to enable his self-destructive behavior. Showing compassion without enabling is the right way to offer support to struggling people.

> Don’t shield them from the consequences of what they choose.

Other ways to support them include spending time with them or simply texting them to let them know you're thinking about them. A random act of kindness can be a ray of light for someone who's found himself in a very dark place.

> Text someone once a week and just say, “I’m thinking about you, you are not going to go through this alone, you do not need to text me back, I just want you to know I am always here.” Invite your friend who just got out of a treatment program to do a yoga class.
