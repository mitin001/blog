This episode of [Darknet Diaries](../../../2025/10/22/darknet-diaries.md) defined a new type of scam.

## What is the watermelon drop scam?

It's a variation of a staged crash played on clueless tourists to con them out of their money.

> For a while in Japan, the prices of watermelons were really high, and so what con artists did is they got ahold of some bad watermelons, ones that were worthless, and they would carry it through a part of town where tourists visit, and they’d intentionally bump into a tourist and drop the watermelon at the same time which would burst open on the ground and make quite a mess. The con artists would then yell and scream at the tourists, saying, _don’t you know how much these are worth? I can’t believe you broke it_. The tourist would feel bad and then pay for the broken watermelon.
