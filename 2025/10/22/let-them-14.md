# 14. People Only Change When They Feel Like It

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered two questions about motivation and decision-making. 

## How to motivate someone to do what you want? 

You can't motivate people; you can only set an example and hope they'll emulate it. People can only motivate themselves.

> You can’t motivate them, because the “feeling” of wanting to do it has to come from within them. The problem with motivation is it’s never there when you need it.

Humans cannot be controlled; they can only be influenced (to a degree). This is a good thing. It gives humans the agency to interact with the world in a much more complex manner than a mere master-slave dyad. This complexity gives rise to truly interesting ideas like individuality and the freedom of expression.

> If you could magically make people “feel like doing” whatever you want them to do, you’d be practicing mind control. . . not motivation.

People cannot be pressured to do something. Humans resist pressure.

> Pressure doesn’t work. Humans are wired to move toward what feels good right now, and to move away from what feels hard in the moment.

Trying to control another human being will always backfire.

> Pressure doesn’t create change—it creates resistance to it. When you try to exert control over someone else’s behavior, they instinctively resist your attempt to try to control them. Instead of inspiring change, your pressure creates a battle over control.

Everyone has the right to autonomy, and you have no right to take it away from them. Any attempt to do so will spark a fight. The people you're trying to control will defend their right to have control over their lives. It's better not to spark such a fight, especially with your loved ones.

> The people that you love only feel safe when they feel in control of their own life. So when you start to push people around, pressure them, or tell them what to do, you are threatening their hardwired need for control over their own lives, decisions, and actions. You’re getting in the way of their agency, the feeling that they are in control of themselves, their life, and their own thoughts and behaviors.

True love is unconditional. Do not love someone on the condition that they must change who they are.

> No one wants to feel pressured by their friends, family, or loved ones. What you want is unconditional love, acceptance, kindness, and compassion. You don’t want to be controlled; you want to feel deeply accepted for who you are, and where you are in your life. That’s what allows you to truly be yourself and feel safe in your relationships.

Everyone has the need for safety, and unconditional love from others helps fulfill this need. When a loved one starts levying demands on you, they're starting to compromise this feeling of safety.

> Acceptance of another person, as they are, is the foundation of a healthy and loving relationship. When someone feels that you accept them as they are, they feel safe with you. The opposite happens when you pressure, change, criticize, push, or expect someone to behave differently than they are. This pressure puts you and your loved one in a battle for control.

When you yield control to another person, you surrender your power. That's how the seeds of resentment are sown.

> The second he does what she says, he loses his sense of agency and she “wins.” At this point, the argument is not about exercising anymore, but who holds the power.

Therefore, the right way to motivate people is not in trying to exert control over them.

> People only change when they are ready to make that change for themselves. Stop punishing them for not changing on your timeline. Stop trying to “motivate” them into doing something they clearly don’t want to do. It is a waste of your time. It is stressing you out. It is ruining your relationship. It is not working. And most importantly, it is driving a wedge between the two of you. Loving people means that you have to meet them where they are. You must learn how to let adults be adults.

The right way to motivate people is to hope they will follow a good example you have set for them. If you want them to exercise, start exercising yourself. If you want them to leave a bad relationship, make sure you're in a good relationship yourself. Make them think that the change they're committing themselves to was their idea, even if they're just trying to follow your formula.

> You can’t motivate someone to change, but you can “inspire” them to change and even make them believe it was all their idea to do so.

## Why is warning someone of negative consequences of their action will not deter them from taking said action?

Because people overestimate their luck. They think they can evade the negative consequences.

> People believe that warning labels, threats, and known risks do not apply to them. That’s why my friend’s husband thinks he’s the only person on the planet who can be overweight and sedentary and never have a heart attack. It’s why he can convince himself that he can stay exactly the same, and nothing bad will happen.

Bad things happen to other people, never to us. Or so we think.

> Everyone thinks they are the exception to bad outcomes happening to them.

Neuroimaging studies confirmed that as we deliberate the course of action to take, our brains are literally blind to bad outcomes of said actions.

> Our brains quite literally tune out the worst case scenarios.

When someone tries to talk you out of taking an action citing a potential bad outcome as a reason, you will not be receptive to such arguments.

> When someone is telling you something negative (“I’ll leave if you don’t stop drinking”) or something you don’t want to hear (“That dude you’re dating is a narcissist”), your brain literally tunes it out.

If someone talks you out of doing something coercively, they stand even less of a chance of getting through to you.

> By being passive-aggressive or constantly bringing it up or using threats as a way to try to pressure someone else to change, it will always backfire.

Do not waste your time and energy trying to scare someone out of doing something. Let them figure out the right course of action by themselves.

> All those threats, worst-case scenarios, passive-aggressive comments, eye rolls, and scare tactics aren’t even registering in the other person’s brain. You are wasting your time, your words, and your breath. No wonder you are so frustrated and stressed out by the situation.
