# [Can Real Social Epistemic Networks Deliver the Wisdom of Crowds?](https://web.archive.org/web/20190128191307if_/https://philarchive.org/archive/SULCRS)

This academic paper on experimental philosophy was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on sealioning](../../../2025/10/20/wikipedia-sealioning.md). It answered three questions about the epistemic value of webpages and social media posts.

## What is Google's PageRank?

> The probability that someone randomly clicking through webpages will end up visiting that page.

If your webpage is linked to by a page with a high PageRank, this will significantly increase the PageRank for your webpage.

> The ranking is not based solely on the number of pages that link to it, but also includes the importance of the pages that link to it. Pages with several links “pass on” some of the value of those links to the pages they link to. One perhaps-counterintuitive result of this approach is that some pages with considerably fewer incoming links can be ranked higher than a page with far more links. The rationale is that if important webpages are linking to something, that in itself is an important indicator if the page’s merit. For example, if _The New York Times_ were to link to another source in its reporting, then that source may have a higher PageRank, even if it is a more obscure page. However, despite the page’s obscurity, it does ground the _Times_    reporting, and thus the content of the page should seem to weigh heavier than the second-hand reporting from the  Times.

## How to rank social media posts by their epistemic usefulness?

Use the PageRank model. If a source with a high PageRank links to your webpage, then your webpage should have a high PageRank. Similarly, if you used a highly epistemically useful source to inform your post, then your post should have a high epistemic usefulness score.

> Sources of testimony that attract more trust are more likely sharing epistemically useful information, which is a strong though defeasible reason to give more weight to those sources.

In this characterization, PageRank is not the same as the number of shares or retweets, which this study found to be uncorrelated to the post's epistemic usefulness.

> Even when individual pediatricians and doctors get involved in debates over vaccine safety (recall that pro-vaccine accounts far outnumber con-vaccine accounts in the core network), their reach and receptivity do not match the reach and receptivity of the con-vaccine accounts.

If you're looking for well-informed, reliable sources do not come to social media. 

> An epistemically treacherous environment.

Social media users don't rise to the top due to their epistemic usefulness but rather by sparkling controversy (and therefore the number of comments under the user's posts) and/or repeating the ideas the members of the community like.

> The wisdom-of-crowds hypothesis needs to be significantly curtailed, especially in regards to polarized topics.

Had people only liked or engaged with posts they found to be epistemically useful, the number of shares would've been a metric of that. Until that is the case, we must rely on a better measure of source reliability to judge the epistemic value of the posts that cite it.

> Perhaps if a formal definition of relying on multiple independent sources could be developed and operationalized for the study of real testimonial networks, it would fare better than PageRank in harnessing the wisdom of crowds.

## Is there value to making a false claim on social media?

Yes. John Stuart Mill would've defended the right of people to express false opinions on social media. Such opinions challenge the status quo, forcing people to re-evaluate whether the opposite still holds true.

> According to Mill, false views are epistemically defensible because expressing false opinions leads to debate, which is one of our best methods for arriving at the truth on a given question. Mill famously indicts those who are unwilling to defend in open debate (what they take to be) the truth as being at risk of having their knowledge demoted to “dead dogma” and “phrases retained by rote.”

The fastest way to get to the truth on the Internet is to say an untruth. Almost certainly, a comment will soon pop up under your post correcting your misinformation. Even if you're committed to only posting the truth, you may inadvertently end up posting the opposite. The world churns out new information by the second, so don't be surprised if something you held with certainty to be the absolute truth will soon be proven untrue or there will be new caveats to consider.
