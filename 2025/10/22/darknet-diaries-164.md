This episode of [Darknet Diaries](../../../2025/10/22/darknet-diaries.md) answered a question about the neuroscience of fear.

## Why do criminals remember their arrests so clearly?

The same reason fear is an exceedingly memorable emotion. Any time you find yourself in danger, the brain commits those moments to memory particularly well. Either the brain works extra hard when the person is in danger or the moment of danger gets frequently revisited and reinforced by the brain after it happens.

> Itâ€™s almost like those are the last moments of freedom that his brain holds onto, or maybe he replays those moments again and again in his head to try to think what he could have done differently.
