# [Disney Files Landmark Case Against AI Image Generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpcWv1lHU6I)

This video was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). Its [transcript](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=6e25271bdbea58d7b2c8b79cfe26b078) answered three questions about tech companies like Midjourney that opt to ask for forgiveness, not permission.

## Why is Disney suing Midjourney?

The same reason why the Prince photographer is suing the Andy Warhol estate to get a cut of the profits they got from licensing the warhol of said photograph to a magazine. Andy Warhol made a warhol out of Prince's photograph, and then the Warhol estate sold the licensing rights to this warhol to a magazine so they could print it on the cover. The photographer wanted a cut of the licensing fee, so she sued the Warhol estate--and won. Because the warhol was a derivative work, derived from her work, she was entitled to compensation. Now, Midjourney generates derivative works from the work of Disney and Universal, and it does so in an automated way--through its AI image generator. So, Disney and Universal are suing to get a cut of the proceeds Midjourney is making from such derivative works.

> Even if users aren't selling the images, the availability of free AI-generated character art may reduce the market for official merchandise, content licensing, or derivative works.

Or, Disney and Universal want to put a stop to Midjourney's ability to generate copyright-violating images outright because otherwise, Midjuorney's models can be used to steal some of the profits from Disney and Universal.

> They can also be used to create knockoffs of the plaintiff's characters, and that Midjourney profits from that.

## What could Midjourney's defense be in Disney's case against it?

Midjourney could say that they're merely indexing the Internet, like any old scraper.

> The Ninth Circuit held that LinkedIn couldn't block a small analytics firm from scraping public user profiles since personal facts aren't copyrightable either. And AI companies like Midjourney argue that they're merely building indexes to the internet, similar to the white pages or public LinkedIn profiles.

They could use the defense from Authors Guild v. Google, which held that Google is allowed to index copyrightable books.

> Google scanned millions of books, some in the public domain, but others still under copyright, and made them searchable, offering only a brief snippet of the copyrighted works. There, the authors and the publishers sued, arguing that the scans were unauthorized and violated copyright law. But after a decade of litigation, the Second Circuit ruled in Google's favor, holding that the digitization and snippet display were fair use. And the court found that Google's use transformative because it created a searchable index that didn't replace the market for the original books. Readers still had to buy the book to read it. So using copyrighted works to train or power a new tool, especially one that doesn't substitute for the original, can qualify as fair use. And AI companies argue that just like Google, their scraping is protected by fair use.

## Why are tech companies flouting the law?

Testing the limits of the law is part of the innovation. Tech companies could argue that because their technology is new, it hasn't been decided by courts yet if what they're doing is necessarily stealing.

> The new technology is moving at warp speed while the law is stuck in traffic.
