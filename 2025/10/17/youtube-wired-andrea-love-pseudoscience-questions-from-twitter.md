# [Biomedical Scientist Answers Pseudoscience Questions From Twitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj71yGp-8WM)

This video was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). Its [transcript](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=56a7f124c96c1998ffb707a3df3f34fb) answered two questions about popular health myths of the day.

## Where did conspiracy theorists get the idea that 5G causes cancer?

They heard that ionizing radiation can cause cancer, and because 5G is also a kind of radiation, they concluded that it must also be causing cancer.

> People heard the word "radio frequency radiation" and got scared because we know that there are certain types of radiation that are linked to cancer.

## Is European bread healthier than American bread?

No, despite the anecdotal reports made by Americans traveling to Europe that European bread makes them feel better. Europe uses all the same pesticides and processes bread in the same way as America.

> Glyphosate is one that's often demonized because it's used to dry down wheat, but it's also used in Europe. Europe imports millions of pounds of American wheat every year to make the very breads that you're eating. I would suggest that maybe you're more relaxed while you're on vacation and you're not gulping down your food in between bringing kids to activities and swallowing air, leading to the perceived feeling of bloat, which has nothing to do with the gluten, but everything to do with the rushing and the stress that you have with your day-to-day life.

European bread makes Americans feel better because they're on vacation, not because the bread itself is better. People on vacation have the time to properly chew their food.
