This Reddit thread is related to [Real Time's 10/4/2025 episode]. It answered two questions about the bizarre AI necklace Bill Maher made fun of in that episode.

## What is the Friend AI necklace good for?

> When you don't have schizophrenia but want to see what it's like.

The Friend AI necklace is an attempt to put an AI chatbot on a wearable device that always listens. A bad idea.

> Generative AI is absolute garbage for and at social connections.

## Why does the Friend AI necklace exist?

> A 22 year old with daddyâ€™s money wanted to have 15 minutes of fame.
