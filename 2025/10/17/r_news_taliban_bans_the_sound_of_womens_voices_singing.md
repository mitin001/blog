This Reddit thread is related to [Real Time's 10/4/2025 episode](../../../2025/10/17/real-time-2025-10-04.md). It answered a question about women's rights in Afghanistan.

## Why did the Taliban ban the sound of women's voices in public?

Because the Taliban ideology holds that a woman's voice is only for her male owner to hear.

> They don't want the women who belong to them to be heard in public by other men, thus, let's ban it all. They likely see it as protecting other men's property.

Yes, the Taliban ideology holds that women are property.

> It's an ownership thing. They want to own women, so that everything the woman is belongs to a male owner, be that the woman's father, husband, or maybe brother or some other relative. And if a man owns a woman, he doesn't want anything of what she is to be seen by other men. They probably even see observing anything about a woman as consumption. A woman is for her owner alone to consume.
