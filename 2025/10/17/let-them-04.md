# 4. Let Them Stress You Out

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered a question about stress. The earlier chapters of this book taught the reader to ignore disappointments, but that won't stop the physiological stress response that will automatically kick in when such a disappointment is strong enough. You must be able to also calm yourself down.

## What to do when someone's behavior is causing a physiological stress response in your body?

Take deep breaths, calm your mind, and let negative emotions pass without engaging with them. Know that this state of fight or flight is temporary and will soon pass. Negative thoughts about the subject of your disappointment will occasionally pop back into your mind, but you can resolve them on the spot. Say "let them do what they want" and remind yourself that you're not in control of that person and that there are better things to do with your time and energy.

> When you allow someone else’s behavior to stress you out, you give other people power. That leaves you drained with no time and energy for yourself. Truth: Your body’s stress response is automatic. You will feel yourself getting annoyed. You will feel frustrated. You will feel the anger and agitation hit. You can’t control the emotions that rise up inside of you. But you can learn how to reset your stress response so your emotions don’t hijack you.
