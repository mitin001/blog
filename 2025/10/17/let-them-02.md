# 2. Getting Started - Let Them and Let Me

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered three questions about mental health and success. This chapter is [longer](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=71d6a398769e1f83af384017b0e899bc) in the audio book.

## What is the difference between saying "let them" and saying "let it go"?

Saying "let it go" doesn't work. It's a casualty of reverse psychology. When you tell your mind that you shouldn't want to continue ruminating on a negative feeling, it just keeps on ruminating on it. When you're trying to run away from something unpleasant in your mind, you just end up running toward it. Saying "let them" works because it identifies the source of your negative feelings: a person to be ignored. You realize they're annoying you, and every time you feel like confronting them about it, you say "let them" to stop yourself. The more you say it, the more at peace you become with an annoying person being nearby. That person has the right to be annoying while you have the right to ignore them and redirect your energy away from them and back to yourself. Do something productive with the energy you've just saved. Mel Robbins refers to this as the Let Them theory.

> This theory is not the same as “letting it go.” Personally, I’ve never been able to let anything go—because it never feels resolved. It feels like you’ve walked away from something that’s bothering you, and just swallowed your feelings and moved on. Let Them is different. When you say Let Them, you’re not giving up or walking away. You’re freeing yourself. You’re releasing that grip you have on how things should go and allowing them to unfold the way they will go. When you let others be who they are, you’re making an active, empowered choice to release control you never truly had. You’re freeing yourself from the endless cycle of stress, frustration, and emotional upheaval that comes with trying to manage everything and everyone.

Saying "let them" reminds you that it's no use to try to control other people.

> Saying Let Them isn't about giving in. It's about releasing yourself from the control that you never had over this situation in the first place.

Suppose someone just disappointed you. Saying the following will make you feel better: "Let them do what they want. Let me go do what I truly want to do." You are in complete control of your emotions.

> When you say Let Them, you are recognizing what’s in your control and what isn’t. Instead of spiraling, you’re choosing to steady yourself and detach.

Looking toward doing something for yourself will fill your mind with positive emotions. Had you kept stewing in your disappointment, you mind would've filled with negative emotions.

> Other people hold no real power over you, unless you give them that power. And every time you say Let Them, you choose to take it back.

You can choose to ignore the disappointing person and not waste any more of your time and energy ruminating over how much they disappointed you and what you could do to prevent this in the future. You can't prevent disappointment.

> The source of your power is not in managing other people; it’s in your response. When you say Let Me, you’re tapping into that power by taking responsibility for what you do, think, or say next. Let Me makes you realize that you are in control of what happens next and that life is more fun and fulfilling when you’re not sitting alone in your superiority.

## How to deal with feelings of abandonment and rejection?

Understand where they're coming from. They're a reminder that you have yet to learn the correct way to have relationships with people: set no expectations and move on to better things and perhaps better people when such feelings creep up on you.

> Buddhism and Radical Acceptance teach that suffering comes from resisting reality. The pain we feel often stems from wishing things were different than they are. The Let Them Theory helps you not only accept reality but also separate yourself from the need to change it. You acknowledge that others’ actions and choices are not yours to control, and in doing so, you reclaim your emotional freedom.

If you stop paying attention to your inner self at a time when you need it most, it will make you sick. That's why feelings of abandonment and rejection are so unpleasant. They are manifestations of your inner self demanding your attention. To make it stop, listen to your inner self and relinquish control. Redirect your energy into self-discovery.

> Trying to control people and situations doesn’t calm your fears. It amplifies them. Any psychologist will tell you, the more you try to control something you can’t, the more anxious and stressed out you become.

The desire to control others is a maladaptation that needs to be unlearned. When people disappoint you, thank them in your mind for not wasting any more of your time.

> Let Them show you who they are. Their disrespect doesn’t say anything about you. How you respond does. Stop asking why they are doing this. The question is, why do you want to be with someone who does this to you? You don’t. Don’t waste your energy chasing someone who’s already left. Focus on what you can control: Processing your emotions and reminding yourself that you deserve someone who treats you with respect.

The author Mel Robbins realized that when she discovered that her friends went on vacation without her, the negative feelings she felt were her own choice. They were not the fault of her inconsiderate friends.

> It was my attempt to control the situation that was making me feel horrible.

## What is the key to success? 

Resilience to rejection.

> One of the keys to being successful is being able to hear rejection and go Let Them and move on. Every single successful entrepreneur has the same story. There were a hundred people that said no before someone said yes.

Success comes from one's built-up resilience to rejection. The pain of rejection should serve as a reminder not to invest too heavily in any one opportunity and quickly move on to try something else. The more you expose yourself to a diverse set of opportunities, the more likely you are to find one that will lead to success.
