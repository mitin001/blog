## What to do when you start to feel jealous? 

Drop comparing yourself to the subject of your jealousy, and start learning from them.

> Flip comparison into your greatest teacher.

Jealously is a maladaptation. What you ought to be doing instead is studying the subject of your jealousy, finding the formula they're following to find success, and applying yourself to said formula.

> Destroy this habit of torturing yourself and obsessing about people and turning life into a competition. Let them lead the way. Plenty of money to go around, let them show me how to make it. Now I just gotta follow the formula.

People don't spark jealousy. They show you an example you ought to be following.

> Look at the data other people’s successes provide.

The feelings of jealousy are simply signals that point you to areas of improvement. 

> Comparison shows you the areas of your life that need more of your attention.

To be effective, jealousy must be a fleeting emotion. As soon as you feel it, jump into action.

> All these people who stir up your jealousy are here to show you the simple fact that while you have been making excuses, they’ve been putting in the reps, slowly chipping away at the boring, hard stuff.

You're jealous of the fact that you've been wasting your time while others have been using theirs productively. Tom Brady notes that most people aren't productive, so even if you start being productive late, you're already ahead of the curve.

> You don’t have to be special. You just have to be what most people aren’t: consistent, determined, and willing to work for it.

Strong emotions like grief, anger, or jealously are useful. They can be channeled into hard work, exactly the sort that leads to the kind of work that makes one successful. Hamlet was written in grief. Anger inspires one to spring into action. It's an antidote to laziness.

> Jealousy is a doorway to your future cracked open, and it’s your job to recognize when it happens, kick the door open, and walk right through it. When you let other people lead the way, you’ll realize that beneath all the fear and excuses and time wasted is the life you’ve wanted all along.

Focused productivity always gets you the desired result. You simply need to invest time, a lot of it, into working toward your goals.

> If you can be honest with yourself about what you truly want, and take responsibility for creating it, you will. You don’t have to be special. You just have to get up every day, put one foot in front of the other, and work hard to do a little better, and be a little better, than you were yesterday. And one of these days, you are going to wake up and realize that you not only changed yourself, but you are in the middle of living the life you were once jealous of.

Feelings of jealousy show you that your goals are attainable. Otherwise, you wouldn't have been jealous of other people. You are only jealous of those have attained your goals for themselves.

> Other people’s success is evidence that you can do it too. By turning inspiration into action, you begin to build the extraordinary life you deserve.

Once you feel jealousy, replace it with joy. The reason you should feel joy upon feeling jealous is because you've just identified your true goals and now have a model to attain those goals. Use the subject of your jealousy as your guide.

> How exciting is it that the most meaningful moments of your life and the deepest connections are just around the corner?
