# [Gish gallop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop)

This Wikipedia article was referenced by [Wikipedia's essay on bludgeoning](../../../2025/10/12/wikipedia-dont-bludgeon.md). It answered two questions about playing dirty in debate.

## What to do when your debate opponent is flooding the zone with a large number of half-truths?

The first tactic to use is the weak point rebuttal. Since the opponent has given you so many options to choose from for your rebuttal, choose the easiest one.

> Because there are too many falsehoods to address, it is wise to choose one as an example. Choose the weakest, dumbest, most ludicrous argument that the galloper has presented and tear that argument to shreds.

Another tactic to use is to call out your opponent's bullshit.

> Call out the strategy by name, saying: "This is a strategy called the 'Gish Gallop'—do not be fooled by the flood of nonsense you have just heard."

## What is the reverse Gish gallop?

It is weaponized pedantry. You find an inconsequential flaw in your opponent's argument, make a big deal out of it, and call the person's credibility into question. That is, if this person is misstating one fact, what else could he be misstating?

> The galloper listens to the opponent's rebuttal; finds an error, approximation, or omission; then attacks that as a way to attack the opponent's credibility. For example, if the correct value is 43 and the opponent says "40" instead of "about 40", then the galloper can use that to suggest the opponent is sloppy and their other arguments are full of errors.
