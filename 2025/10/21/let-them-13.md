# 13. How To Create The Best Friendships of Your Entire Life

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered a question about friendships.

## How to do friendships right? 

If you're friends with someone who doesn't reciprocate your friendship, fight the need to be clingy by saying, "let them leave." Keep saying it while ignoring the negative emotions that occasionally rise up in you as you process the loss of that friendship. Once the friendship is over, realize that you've been expending significant time and energy on sustaining it and that those have just been freed up. You can redirect those resources to starting a new friendship or nurturing an existing one. Reach out to someone old or new; start building a better support system of friends around yourself.

> When you say Let Them, you release the need to cling to friendships that no longer serve you, making space for connections that truly matter. When you say Let Me, you take charge of your social life, reaching out, initiating, and cultivating the kind of friendships that reflect your values and bring you happiness. It’s time to stop waiting and start creating—building the best friendships of your life and surrounding yourself with a community that uplifts and supports you.
