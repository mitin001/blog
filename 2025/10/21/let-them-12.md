# 12. Why Some Friendships Naturally Fade

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered a question about friendships.

## How to determine which of your friendships can be pruned?

Let them reach out to you first. If they never do, the friendship has run out of fuel. Don't use your energy to fuel this friendship. Let the other person. If they don't, redirect the energy you would've used on it to your other, more deserving friends.

> As you say Let Them, people will reveal exactly who they are, and they reveal where you stand in their life.

You could still try to rekindle this friendship later. Surprising people with unexpected attention can be extremely rewarding. Showing them you still think about them months or years later will mean a lot to them.

> Before you walk away from a friendship, assume good intent on the other person’s part. Sometimes, you’re just friends with someone who never makes plans, or is extremely introverted, or who has a lot of heavy or demanding things going on in their life. It’s not that they are ghosting you; it’s that they are exhausted by the chapter of life they are in. It’s not personal that they’ve become distant. And the fact that you still reach out may be the lifeline that they need.

It's possible that the friend simply is going through a tough or demanding time in their life right now and can't contribute much to a friendship.

> If you’ve ever received a call or text from someone you’ve lost touch with, it’s one of the greatest surprises in the world.

If you reach out to them once they are ready, you may still have a lasting, meaningful friendship with them.
