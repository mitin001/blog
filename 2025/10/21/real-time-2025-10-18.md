# [Real Time](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/742515): [10/18/2025](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=0cdff2bd7db199c002395d6acf62222a)

This episode of [Real Time](../../../2025/10/16/real-time.md) answered two questions about the great American divide.

## How to counter a conservative who says that liberals hate America?

When Trump ordered masked ICE agents to roam American streets to punish anyone suspected of being in the country illegally (or, it seems, doing anything they didn't like), liberals exercised their constitutional right to protest peacefully. They protested such practices because they saw them as unamerican. Conservatives didn't.

> If you won't stop assembling freely and speaking freely, we are going to send our masked, unaccountable secret police to arrest you. As America should be.

## Why do people cheer on a politician crashing out in public?

Because civil society is no longer civil.

> It's an angry country full of assholes.

Exposure to social media and Trump has caused a great many members of our society to lose all traces of civility. Whereas in the past politicians who wanted to seem relatable resorted to kissing babies, now they they accomplish the same by crashing out in public. It seems that the worse their temper tantrum, the louder the cheers from the populace.

> It's like, "Hey, one of us."
