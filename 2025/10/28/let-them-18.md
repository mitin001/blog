# 18. Let Them Show You Who They Are

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered three questions about romantic relationships that ought to be ended.

## How to not let a romantic failure leave a mental scar? 

As soon as the relationship starts feeling like a burden, leave it. Learn to let people go. Analyze your situation like an outside observer would. What would you recommend yourself, had your emotions not clouded your judgment?

> If your best friend were being treated this way, what would you tell them?

## What does it mean when someone says they don't want to put a label on your relationship with them? 

It means they're not in a relationship with you. Just as "maybe" means "no" in invitation responses, weaseling out of labels in a relationship means there is no relationship.

> "Well, I don't really want to put a label on this." "Oh, you don't? Okay." Well, that's a pretty clear signal. "I don't want to put a label on this" means I don't choose you. And then you're going to go, "Not yet. Not yet." I'm not saying don't stay in and see where it goes. I'm saying be brave.

Be brave and let yourself start letting go of the person that's using you. Letting yourself be used is not an investment, it's a waste.

> "I don't want any labels because I don't want to be tied to you."

## What does it mean when someone sends you mixed signals? 

It means they're using you. They're only showing interest in you when they need something, and the rest of the time, they're showing disinterest.

> If somebody is sending you mixed signals, it means they are NOT interested. Mixed signals aren’t “mixed” at all. They send a very clear message that you are not a priority; you’re a convenience. For example, if they are texting you nonstop, but they never suggest a plan to get together, they are not interested in anything real.

If you're looking for people online, set limits in your mind for how long they can string you along with text messages. If they reject your invitation to talk on the phone or on video or to meet in the real world, then move on.

> You always have the power to cut the cord. You are an active participant in the stringing along, because you’re allowing them to do it.

Most importantly, don't play by other people's rules. Don't change who you are just to fit someone's idea of an ideal date. You're looking for a person who's interested in just who you already are.

> If you’re making excuses for someone else’s behavior. . . stop. Let Them reveal who they truly are. Let Them reveal whether or not they make an effort. Let Them reveal whether or not they care. The biggest thing that makes dating confusing is your refusal to see the fact that they don’t care about you the way you wish they would. We’ve all been there. It’s painful when you are interested in someone and those feelings are not returned. But you can’t control who another person chooses to love. Do not spend your time trying to shrink yourself into a tiny little box, or become someone new, or change who you are, just to be in a relationship with someone who doesn’t love you back. Don’t do it.

Don't try to contort into the void left in their heart by another.

> As extraordinary as love is, it’s also the source of so much pain. You want to be loved so much that you can find yourself giving your power away to the other person. For example, maybe some stranger you met online now dictates your mood. Maybe someone who ghosted you has now destroyed your self-esteem. Or your spouse is very dismissive and treats you like a roommate, which you have just learned to accept. In your love life, you can fall into the trap of letting other people—and their own traumas and issues—make you compromise your standards and settle for far less than what you truly want and know you need.

You will never fill the void in someone's heart. They have to fill it themselves. Love is something else.

> Just like the shoe isn’t going to grow to fit you, neither will this person shape-shift into who you hope they will be. That’s why you have to stop chasing. The more time you waste chasing the wrong people, the longer it’s going to take you to find the right one. Let Them ghost you. Let Me move on. Stop chasing the potential of who someone might be. Stop pouring your time and energy into people who do not give it back to you. Stop explaining away their disrespectful behavior. Stop giving your love to people who do not love you back. Stop making excuses for people who are clearly not interested in you. Stop chasing people who are not choosing to love you back. Stop playing the game.

If a person leaves you feeling confused as to what you mean to them, then it's not love.

> If someone likes you, you’ll know, and if they don’t, you’ll be confused. Feeling confused is a very dangerous place to be when you’re dating because if you like them, your knee-jerk reaction will be to convince yourself that they like you.

You can't make anyone love you and investing your time and energy into trying is a waste.

> Haven’t you noticed that the only people you feel confused by are the ones who don’t like you back? See the confusion that you feel for what it is. It means they don’t like you the way you want them to. When you convince yourself that something is happening when it’s clearly not, you’re chasing love. Chasing love only chases it away. Chasing the wrong person always leads you to the wrong places. Chasing the potential means you know something isn’t right and you’re ignoring the truth.

There's nothing you can say that will make someone fall in love with you, regardless of what your desperate kind has been telling you.

> You believe there is a text that you could send that might get them to want you back.

Love is chemistry. The chemical reaction either happens at first sight, or it never will. By staying in a lukewarm relationship where you are being sent mixed signals, you're denying yourself the possibility to experience the sparks flying with another person who will love you back.
