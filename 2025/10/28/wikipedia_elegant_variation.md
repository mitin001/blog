## What is elegant variation?

It's a poor writing style where the writer, intent on avoiding pronouns, resorts to desperately seeking new descriptors for the subject of his writing with every new mention of it. 

> A humorist imagined writing a news article about Gaston Defferre: "It's OK to say Defferre once, but not twice. So next you say the Mayor of Marseille. Then, the Minister of Planning. Then, the husband of Edmonde. Then, Gaston. Then, Gastounet and then... Well, then you stop talking about him because you don't know what to call him next."

Word of advice: if you're writing about a king, don't resort to calling him the Emperor, His Majesty, and the Monarch in the next three sentences.

> Such extreme variations make it difficult to follow the sense of the sentence when the reader is distracted by wondering what the King will be called next time.

What you called him the first time will do just fine. Alternate it with a pronoun if you have to. You're not AI. You're not penalized by repeating words in your writing. You're simply communicating to other people, so make what you're communicating as easy for your readers to understand as possible.
