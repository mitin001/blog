# [Critical Ignoring](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7615324/)

This academic paper was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on sealioning](../../../2025/10/20/wikipedia-sealioning.md). It answered three questions about the information-attention conflict.

## How to get someone to believe a blatant falsehood?

Frame it as a question.

> JAQing (“just asking questions”) is a tactic of disingenuously framing false or misleading statements as questions.

Are we finally in possession of weapons that can destroy the entire galaxy? The answer is no, but now you're thinking about it. If at a later time you are asked to label the statement "the weapons of mass destruction are powerful enough to destroy the galaxy" as true or false, you're likelier to label it "true" because the statement will ring a bell for you. You'd think that you've already heard it somewhere, so it must be true, even though you've heard it in a question, the answer to which was no. Holocaust deniers exploit this vulnerability of human cognition by spreading their incendiary falsehoods by asking offensive questions on online history forums. They've gotten so brazen that r/AskHistorians resorted to banning such questions on the spot. 

> reddit.com’s AskHistorians subreddit, one of the largest history forums online, removes questions that use the JAQing technique to deny the basic facts of the Holocaust.

Yes, there's such a thing as a stupid question. It doesn't matter how forcefully the claim is debunked when it's in bold letters at the top of the page.

## Are you in control of where you direct your attention? 

Not anymore. You're addicted to a device that feeds you only those parts of the digital world that makes the most money for its makers (or the makers of its software). This is partly evidenced by the fact that we have to consciously oppose the algorithm to get a grip on where we direct our attention.

> Investing effortful and conscious critical thinking in sources that should have been ignored in the first place means that one’s attention has already been expropriated.

People now must actively work against scores of malicious actors trying to monopolize on our attention.

> Prevent merchants of low-quality information from hijacking their cognitive resources.

This is a necessary consequence of the information age. The more information there is, the thinner we coat this information with our attention.

> A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.

## Does Facebook encourage its advertisers to use incendiary language? 

Yes, that's the kind of language that best grabs the attention of the public, and Facebook gives its advertisers the tools to craft it.

> Messages featuring moral-emotional language (e.g., language expressing negative emotions, such as moral outrage) are more likely to be shared than messages with neutral language are.

Facebook encourages its advertisers to find the most incendiary language possible to maximize the reach of their ads with tools like A/B testing where the selection criteria track engagement, or rather, as it often turns out, enragement.

> Unscrupulous content generators can exploit this bias and can continually refine their messages by monitoring the success (measured by engagement and sharing) of different versions—a facility, known as “A/B testing,” that is at the heart of Facebook’s advertising system.

What is incendiary, attention-getting language? The language that was found by A/B testing to hijack people's attention the most.
