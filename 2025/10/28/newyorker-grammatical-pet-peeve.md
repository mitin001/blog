# [The Objectively Objectionable Grammatical Pet Peeve](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-objectively-objectionable-grammatical-pet-peeve)

This article was referenced by [Wikipedia's essay on elegant variation](../../../2025/10/15/wikipedia_the_problem_with_elegant_variation.md). It answered three questions about writing from the point of view of a grammarian.

## Why is word order more important in English than in other languages? 

Because in English, we don't modify word endings to help the reader distinguish between the subject and object of a sentence, etc. So, it falls on the word order to make such delineations.

> In Latin, word order is flexible because words have forms or endings that make their grammatical functions clear, no matter where in a sentence they occur. English is different. It lost almost all its inflections centuries ago, and, when it did, word order became indispensable to establishing meaning: it’s the reason that we immediately know the difference between “dog bites man” and “man bites dog.”

Do not use unconventional word order to spice up your writing in English because word order is all you have to communicate to the reader which parts of your sentence are modified by which other parts. Mess with word order, and you will surely confuse your reader.

## Why do people begin sentences with appositives like "A former resident of Brooklyn, Mrs. Jones is..."?

This style of writing has become trendy among writers of English.

> The first phrase is an appositive—typically a noun or noun phrase that modifies another noun or noun phrase, which appears next to it in the sentence. (“A former resident of Brooklyn” and “Mrs. Jones” refer to the same person, so they are said to be “in apposition.”) Appositives almost always follow the noun they modify, and are set off by commas.

One would be hard-pressed to find such writing in the classics. It's a recent development.

> The practice had probably originated in efforts by newspaper writers and editors to save column inches by squeezing more information into smaller spaces.

The format of newspaper columns necessitated a simple way to expand our contract text so it would fill the space allocated for it on the page, and sentry participles were it.

> Short paragraphs used in newspapers as filler.

H. W. Fowler collected many examples of such.

> “Winner of many rowing trophies, Mr Robert George Dugdale, aged seventy-five, died at Eton”; “Aged seventy-nine, the Rev. F. T. Wethered, vicar of Hurley, near Marlow, whose death is announced, bathed daily in the Thames, winter & summer, till a few months ago”; “Found standing in play astride the live rail of the electric line at Willesden & in danger of instant death, Walter Spentaford, twelve, was fined 12s. for trespass”.

Why leave an ugly blank space on the page of a newspaper when you could add trivia about the subject of the article, especially when all you have to do to work it into the article is delimit it with a comma before the subject's name or yet another appositive?

## What is elegant variation?

It's when a writer avoids repeating a pronoun by introducing a new fact about the subject of his sentence every time a pronoun would do just fine. "I ate a banana. It was ripe. It was delicious." There's nothing wrong with repeating the pronoun.

> A banana is never ‘the elongated yellow fruit.’

There's everything wrong with replacing every pronoun with a new, likely unnecessary, fact.
