# *[When to Rob a Bank (2015)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/When_to_Rob_a_Bank/2lidBAAAQBAJ)*

I learned about the *Freakonomics* series from *Orange Is the New Black*, in which Big Boo referenced the first book in explaining to Tiffany Doggett how the legalization of abortion had lowered the crime rate in America.

After completing _Think Like a Freak_, a third volume in the _Freakonomics_ series, I was delighted to learn that there's a fourth, _When to Rob a Bank_.
