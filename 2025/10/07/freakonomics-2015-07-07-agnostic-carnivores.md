# 07-07. Agnostic Carnivores

This section of the book *[When to Rob a Bank (2015)](../../../2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md)* answered a question about corporate greed intersecting environmentalism.

## Why go vegan when rotational grazing is a sustainable way to produce meat for the consumer?

Because it is not sustainable. The sustainability of rotational grazing is a myth corporations invented to make the consumer feel good about buying their unsustainably produced product. The impact of switching to rotational grazing in terms of limiting damage the environment is minimal. The best thing you can do to reduce your carbon footprint with respect to eating meat is just stop eating it.

> The underlying appeal in the pasture solution is something not so much calculated as irrational: pastured animals mimic, however imperfectly, symbiotic patterns that existed before humans arrived to muck things up. In this sense, rotational grazing supports one of the more appealing (if damaging) myths at the core of contemporary environmentalism: the notion that nature is more natural in the absence of human beings. Put differently, rotational grazing speaks powerfully to the aesthetics of environmentalism while confirming a bias against the built environment.

The environment can't support the human population if every human expects to uncontrollably gorge on meat, even if images of happy cows on the packaging suggest otherwise.
