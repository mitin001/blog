# 07-06. How About Them (Wrapped) Apples?

This section of the book *[When to Rob a Bank (2015)](../../../2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md)* answered two questions about food waste.

## Why should you make more trips to the grocery store rather than store extra food in your home?

Because the food you don't consume quickly will rot. In the grocery store, you compete with other humans for food. In your own home, you compete with mold and other microorganisms. Nature won't wait forever for you to eat the food you've bought or grown. If you take too long, the food will be promptly colonized by mold. And there are even more ways of punishing the sluggish eater that have evolved in nature. When the food isn't consumed promptly, it will rot, disturbing everyone around it with methane gas. Methane is an assault on your sense of smell, and it's also an assault on the environment.

> Decaying food emits methane, a greenhouse gas that’s more than twenty times more potent than carbon dioxide.

Of course, nature isn't deliberately making those choices. These circumstances evolved organically as the optimal system in which everyone can coexist. Mold and bacteria take advantage of the careless consumer who takes too long to eat their food, and methane is the byproduct that makes sense in terms of their metabolic systems. We must learn to exist in the circumstances we are in and not fight them. For us as food consumers it means to get our hands on just enough food we actually need and consume it promptly.

## What is more of a problem: food packaging or food waste? 

Food waste, by far. Some consumers will point to food packaging as a more urgent problem to solve than food waste, but this idea is born out of ignorance.

> If you’re truly eager to take on the waste inherent in our food systems, you’d be better off reforming your own habits at home—say, by buying more strategically, minimizing waste, and eating less—before taking on the institutional packaging practices of disembodied food distributers.

Food packaging is a way to keep food from rotting sooner. It is a solution to the problem of food waste, imperfect but practical. In further reducing the environmental impact of food packaging, we shouldn't compromise on its effectiveness. The problem it solves is much more environmentally damaging than the problem is introduces.

> Waste is an inevitable outcome of production. As consumers, we should certainly see food packaging as a form of waste and seek increasingly responsible packaging solutions. At the same time, though, we must do so without resorting to pat calls to “reduce packaging.” Doing so, it seems, could do more harm than good.

The food packaging industry is making progress toward being eco-friendly. Its designers have already taken crucial first steps toward responsible packaging.

> A lot of goods are packaged to ensure that we use the entire product. They contain user-friendly features such as capacious openings (milk), transparent appearance (bagged salad), re-sealers (nuts), the ability to be turned upside down (ketchup), and smooth surfaces rather than grooved ones, where food can hide (yogurt).

When choosing food packaging, remember that the priority is reducing food waste, not packaging waste.
