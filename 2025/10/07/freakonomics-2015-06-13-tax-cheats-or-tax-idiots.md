# 06-13. Tax Cheats or Tax Idiots

This section of the book *[When to Rob a Bank (2015)](../../../2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md)* defines the IRS.

## What is the Internal Revenue Service?

> The IRS is like a street cop or, more precisely, the biggest fleet of street cops in the world, who are asked to enforce laws written by a few hundred people on behalf of a few hundred million people, a great many of whom find these laws too complex, too expensive and unfair.

The government knows exactly how much you owe it, but if you don't happen to arrive at the same number as the government, you will be harshly penalized, regardless of whether you tried to cheat the system or made an honest mistake. And there are plenty of opportunities for mistakes, just as there are hoardes of opportunists who know how to cheat without getting caught. It's a deliberately broken system. If the US regains its sanity, there will be a tax reform, with the end result remaking the IRS into a government body that will send every American citizen a bill in January asking them to make up the difference between the tax they owe and the tax they already paid last year. This IRS would be like any public utility. Let's hope some day this becomes the definition of the IRS.
