This article was referenced by the [Wikipedia article about the automatic complaint-letter generator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Complaint-Letter_Generator), which, in turn, was referenced by [Wikipedia's discussion about chatbot comments in discussions](../../../2025/10/07/wikipedia_chatbot_comments_in_discussions.md). It defined the automated complaint-letter generator, an LLM that existed 30 years before the age of the LLM.

## What is the automated complaint-letter generator?

A [website](https://www.pakin.org/complaint) written in the 1990s that roasts on request.

> Fires off whole paragraphs of invective to anyone you wish.

The creator of the website noticed patterns in complaint letters written by college students and realized that they could be simulated by a computer.

> He was inspired to write this program as an undergraduate after reading the pointless ramblings that appeared in the Carnegie-Mellon student newspaper. "I bet a computer could write letters that make as much sense as this," he recalls thinking.

The output of this web service from the 1990s rivals that of the overly safe, heavily filtered output of large language models of the 2020s.
