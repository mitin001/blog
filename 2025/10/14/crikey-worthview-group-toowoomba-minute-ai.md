# [Using AI to rip off other outletsâ€™ articles](https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/02/05/worthview-group-toowoomba-minute-artificial-intelligence/)

This article was referenced by an [article on the proliferation of LLM bots on Twitter](../../../2025/10/10/abc.net.au-twitter-x-bot-problem.md). It answered a question about AI slop spammers.

## Do the spammers check the validity of the AI clones of the websites from which they're trying to steal traffic?

It doesn't appear that they do. There was even a website that was supposed to clone a local news site for a town in Australia but ended up cloning an American website for a town that had a similar name but was on the other side of the world.

> Articles from Queensland local news sites are strikingly similar to content from the ABC, the government and even from a US-based newspaper for a city that shares a name with an Australian town.
