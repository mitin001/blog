This episode of [Pivot](../../../2025/10/14/pivot.md) answered ten questions about success, happiness, interpersonal relationships, psychotherapy, and even how to be safe from technology.

## Why did _Let Them_ become so successful?

The author Mel Robbins says it's because of confirmation bias.

> Because I'm reminding you of what you already know to be true.

The secret to success is also making things appear simple.

> It's very easy to make something complicated. It is extraordinarily difficult and takes a lot of rigor to distill complicated things into a simple thing that anybody can use.

This is the reason the iPhone became so successful. It was an easy-to-use smartphone at the time when the alternative was the Windows Phone.

> It's hard to make complex things simple. It's easy to make simple things complex.

## What is the secret to happiness? 

Let things go. Most things are beyond your control, so don't stress about them.

> All this stuff that we're upset about's already happening.

You can't stop bad things from happening. You can only stop letting them get to you.

> Any of the, "Ahh," that you do that only stresses you out, by the way, which only compromises your ability to stay calm, confident, focused, and strategic.

Keep reminding yourself to redirect your time and energy away from things you can't control.

> Why on earth would you give your two most important resources which is your time and your energy to all these idiots walking around that are disrespectful, rude, and annoying? Don't do it. Your time and energy is so much more valuable. So when you say, "Let them," what you're doing is you're reminding yourself that whatever is triggering you right now is not deserving of your time and energy.

When you're dealing with a difficult person, don't try to change them. Just accept them for who they are and find ways to limit the amount of time and energy you give them.

> One of the most dangerous things you can do is hope that the person's gonna change. If you say, "Let them," let their behavior be the truth of who this person is. You are forcing yourself to recognize who this person is, and now let me decide how much time do they get, how much energy do they get of mine. Let me stop wishing they would change, and let me just actually learn how to accept who this person is and who they aren't, and stop gaslighting myself with some fantasy about who they may become.

The false belief that people can change is a healing fantasy developed in one's childhood. A more mature person should draw on their life experience to realize that the best way to deal with a difficult person is to treat them exactly the way they deserve to be treated and have no illusions about their ability to grow. You can't change others, you can only change how much time and energy you give them. The secret to happiness is in putting boundaries.

> The moment you feel frustrated about anything, and you'll notice it's 99% of the time about other people's behavior, and you say "let them," your shoulders drop because you're putting a boundary up between yourself and the world where normally you'd allow the outside world and other people to impact you.

## How to influence people to change? 

Not by telling them to change.

> The second I tell you what to do, I bump up against your need to control yourself. So instead of motivating you, you know what I just did? I actually created the standoff.

It's almost impossible to get people to change. You could try to model the behavior you would want them to emulate, but have no illusions that it's necessarily going to work.

## Why is it a bad idea to obsess about Trump? 

Because, like any narcissist, he feeds on your obsession, hollowing you out from the inside and wasting your time and energy. 

> When you're dealing with somebody that has a personality style that is narcissistic, the people around that person constantly give that behavior power by trying to explain it. Instead, let them reveal who they are, and stop gaslighting yourself into believing this person's ever gonna change.

## Why is it a bad idea to seek mental health help from AI?

Because AI is a sycophant, not a therapist. It will validate your bad ideas, not steer you toward developing resilience and acceptance.

> AI tends to feed you validation, and it gives you answers, not options. And based on the prompts that people give, it's only searching the language, but it's taking no other cues like emotion, tone of voice, stress levels and responses that you can see, past history.

## How to overcome phone addiction?

Treat the phone like a tool, not a slot machine.

> Stop blaming the phone and actually recognize that the phone is a tool, what's on it is addictive, but if you know it's addictive, then adjust your behavior so that you don't become the tool.

Recognize situations when the phone is not appropriate to have nearby.

> In moments I want to be in person, I have to have my phone off my person.

It is inappropriate to have the phone by your bed if your objective is to get enough sleep.

> Cocaine's addictive. I don't sleep next to an eight ball.

It's inappropriate to bring the phone to the dinner table if your objective is to catch up with your loved ones.

> I started to train myself to put my phone off my body when I was coming downstairs and it's time for dinner.

It's harder for young people to overcome phone addiction because they often find themselves in a situation where the phone is the only thing that gives them access to their social needs.

> They wish everybody weren't on their phones as much, but the problem is the social pressure.

## Why do people doom-scroll for hours? 

Because they don't feel like they're in control of their lives most of them time. So, when they get the opportunity to doom-scroll, they overdo it, as if to show themselves that there's still part of their lives that is under their control.

> All day long, we feel like our time and energy has been hijacked by work, by other people's drama, by the stress of life, by the headlines that when you get home and you plop on the couch, there's almost like this fuck-you experience that you have and you're like, _I'm just gonna take back my life and go to this place by spending three hours doing nothing._

Of course, this is a counterproductive way to assert control. By giving up self-control.

## Why do people watch horror or crime thrillers for entertainment? 

There's something wrong with them because these things are relaxing to them.

> That is an indication of trauma.

## What is the difference between guilt and shame?

> Guilt is when I did something bad, and shame is when you say, _I'm bad because of what I did_.

Remember that guilt is simply a signal to correct your behavior. After that, feel free to discard this emotion. Always feel free to discard shame. It's an emotion others evoke in you to try to manipulate you. When you're feeling shame, think of yourself in the third person and reassess that person's position as one deserving your empathy, not rejection.

## Do women know how to be friends better than men? 

Perhaps. Men seem to struggle differentiating between their individual friends.

> Guys have defaulted to needing groups to be organized in order to feel like you have relationships with other people.

Kara Swisher has recognized this pattern in her own family.

> My daughter has individual friends, and my sons have _the boys_.
