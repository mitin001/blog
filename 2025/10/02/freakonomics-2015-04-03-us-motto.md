## What makes America exceptional?

Because even its worst critics prefer to stay. A Freakonomics blog reader purposes this to be a new motto for America.

> “Our Worst Critics Prefer to Stay” is, while perhaps not outright uplifting, a wonderfully concise acknowledgment of the paradox that a capitalist democracy inevitably is: a place that is often well worth complaining about, and which allows you to complain as loudly as you wish.

It's right up there with Bill Maher's "capitalism is the worst economic system, except for all the others." The grass is not greener anywhere else in the world, but, as Mel Robbins would say, be reminded that the grass is only greener if you water it. Take care of this country. Exercise your free speech. When you see something, say something. If you see power being abused, blow the whistle. Protect our institutions. Some may argue that under Trump and his authoritarian leanings, America is no longer exceptional. Some celebrities, like Rosie O'Donnell, have even left this country in protest. It's up to us to keep America exceptional even through its takeover by the likes of Trump.
