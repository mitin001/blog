# [The Twitter Account That Collects Awkward, Amusing Writing](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-twitter-account-that-collects-awkward-amusing-writing)

This article was referenced by [Wikipedia's essay on elegant variation](../../../2025/10/15/wikipedia_the_problem_with_elegant_variation.md). It made me answer a question about writing.

## Should you embed words from the thesaurus into your writing? 

No, if you have to reach for words outside of your mind, then you're doing it wrong. Writing is about communication. Express what you must convey to your reader, pour your mind onto paper, make it as easy as possible for your reader to understand. If you start cutting words out of a thesaurus or an LLM and pasting them into your writing, you're overcomplicating things. You wouldn't be alone in the camp of writers who'd rather borrow words from others than allow their writing to get personal. There are entire armies of students and journalists who think elegant variation or synonym-spinning is better than anything they could come up with. They're all wrong.

> Variation, and how to achieve it, has obsessed people across languages and culturesâ€”the thesaurus has been cashing this check for centuries.

I assure you, everything you need to write is already in your head. If you can't come up with a response to a writing prompt, then read something, live your life, and collect life experience. You'll soon have something to write about. If you can't come up with a word, however, then just think harder. It will come to you, and it will fit your story perfectly. If you find a word somewhere other than in your mind, you may be relieved that the search is over, but you won't be satisfied. The word won't be yours; a patch pasted from elsewhere will stick out; it won't belong in your story.
