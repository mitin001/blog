# 20. How Every Ending is a Beautiful Beginning

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered a question about mental health in romantic relationships.

## How to heal from a breakup?

Fill your calendar, distract yourself. Simply ignoring your feelings won't work.

> It is not time that heals. It is what you do with that time that matters.

Your mind will constantly wander right back into its darkest recesses, and you must deliberately lead it right back into normalcy.

> Nothing is worse for a breakup than an idle mind. If you don’t have things to keep you busy, you will busy yourself by thinking about them.

Everything takes work. Even something as marvelous as a human mind doesn't heal on its own.

> The grass is greener where you water it.

Remember: you still haven't broken up with yourself. The most important relationship you can have is still there, and it'll always be there.

> You are the love of your life. And the life you create—full of meaningful relationships, joy, and fulfillment—begins with how you choose to love yourself.

It's time to shift the focus away from the person who probably didn't deserve your love and direct it back at yourself.

> You are the source of your own happiness, your own fulfillment, and your own joy. When you truly embrace that, everything else falls into place.

Fill your inner world, and the outside world will take note and match it. Your soulmate and your dream job don't just come to this who wait. They are pulled by the attractive force within you, should you choose to grow it.
