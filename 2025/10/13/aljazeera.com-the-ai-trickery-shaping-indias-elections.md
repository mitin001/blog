This article was referenced by [an article about pro-Iseael LLM bots](../../../2025/10/12/aljazeera-are-you-chatting-with-an-ai-powered-superbot.md). It answered a question about ethical AI.

## What are ethical uses of deepfakes?

Political gimmicks, like creating personalized greetings for your constituents.

> 30-year-old Divyendra Singh Jadoun runs an AI startup, The Indian Deepfaker. Launched in October 2020, his company cloned the voice of Rajasthan state’s Congress chief ministerial candidate Ashok Gehlot for his team to send personalised messages on WhatsApp, addressing each voter by their name, during November assembly elections.

However, it goes beyond gimmicks aimed at people with low digital literacy. AI can be used to dub a video in a different language. Indian politicians have been doing it since early 2020.

> In February 2020, Manoj Tiwari, a BJP member of parliament, became among the world’s first to use deepfakes for campaigning. In three videos, Tiwari addressed voters in Delhi ahead of the capital’s legislative assembly elections in Hindi, Haryanvi and English – reaching three distinct audiences in the multicultural city. Only the Hindi video was authentic: The other two were deepfakes, where AI was used to generate his voice and words and alter his expressions and lip movement.

Compare the pre-ChatGPT world to now. If AI was already determined by some high-profile figures to be good enough for dubbing then, by now it has probably advanced to the point where it's good enough for most people.
