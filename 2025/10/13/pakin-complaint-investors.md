# [The Investor's Business Journal's article about the complaint-letter generator](https://web.archive.org/web/20071016124904/http://pakin.org/complaint-info/investors.html)

This article was referenced by the [Wikipedia article about the automatic complaint-letter generator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Complaint-Letter_Generator), which, in turn, was referenced by [Wikipedia's discussion about chatbot comments in discussions](../../../2025/10/07/wikipedia_chatbot_comments_in_discussions.md). It answered a question about the human tendency to anthropomorphize LLMs.

## Why do people believe LLMs?

The same reason people believe psychics or anyone who makes things up confidently. Programmer Pakin created an automatic complaint letter generator in the 1990s, and even then, people took computer-generated nonsense at its word.

> Pakin compares people's tendency to notice the statements true to their situation and disregard the completely inaccurate statements to people's comments on "hand reading, horoscopes, psychic readings and such."

Pakin received comments from his users bewildered by the fact that his madlibs program produced something that others thought were true statements.

> I have spent several hours today sending personalized complaints to all my friends. It's amazing how accurate they are! I posted a complaint about Bill Gates on alt.fan.bill-gates and I have received several thoughtful responses. One lady thought I was right on.
