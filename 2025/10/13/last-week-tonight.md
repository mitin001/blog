# Last Week Tonight

Prior to the 2016 election, *Last Week Tonight* ran a deep dive on Trump, which was uploaded to YouTube by the creators in full as it appeared on HBO. The premium content was shared widely on social media, which is how it got my attention. The video was an excellent public service announcement warning the voters that Trump was a con artist. I couldn't get enough of *Last Week Tonight* since.
