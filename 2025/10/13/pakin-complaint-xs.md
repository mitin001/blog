This article was referenced by the [Wikipedia article about the automatic complaint-letter generator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Complaint-Letter_Generator), which, in turn, was referenced by [Wikipedia's discussion about chatbot comments in discussions](../../../2025/10/07/wikipedia_chatbot_comments_in_discussions.md). It answered a question about using an LLM for evil.

## How to use an LLM to roast someone? 

Don't use an LLM. Their overly safe content filters won't let you write a good roast. Use the [automated complaint-letter generator](https://www.pakin.org/complaint) from the 1990s, back when people weren't as fragile and expected more from generated text than plain sycophancy. 

> The program Pakin created works by stringing together words and phrases commonly found in complaint letters to generate its own peevish missive to a designated person. It contains such adjectives as bloodthirsty, irrational, and unscrupulous, and nouns like boneheads and dorks. In all, the program has 282 sentence skeletons, 170 independent clauses, 183 adjectives, and 123 nouns, for a potential of over 1 billion sentences.
