# Last Week Tonight: [12.21. August 17, 2025](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=8c8f819bb6c0f73497fcae0983c0828f)

This episode of [Last Week Tonight](../../../2025/10/13/last-week-tonight.md) answered a question about the MAGA movement.

## Is RFK Jr. interested in "making America healthy"?

No, it's a grift all the way down. The function of RFK Jr. is to distract people with grandiose pronouncements about food dyes and Tylenol while Trump is quietly dismantling the last remaining oversight bodies for the corporations in charge of our food and medications.

> MAHA is not about making America healthy again. At best, it is about laundering the reputation of an administration that is doing the exact opposite.

Forcing corporations to make their food healthier requires regulation, which is at odds with the MAGA movement.

> Cleaning up our food in America is gonna require more regulation, and so I'm just not understanding how we're going to clean up our food through regulation in an administration that ran on deregulation.
