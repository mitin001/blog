# 5. Let Them Think Bad Thoughts About You

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered a question about making decisions in an adversarial environment.

## How to succeed in an environment where people are negative toward you? 

Ignore them and quietly do what you need. The world is an adversarial environment. Do not let your adversaries guide your actions. This will only exhaust you.

> Even when you bend over backward and try to please everyone, and make it work, even THAT won’t guarantee that other people will think a positive thought.

Only let yourself guide your actions, and don't be distracted by what others think of them. Do not make yourself the subject of your disappointment. This will shut down your only true guide to navigate life.

> Someone is always going to be disappointed by the decisions that you make. Don’t ever let it be you that’s disappointed. And don’t let guilt drive your decisions.

The only person you can count on is you. When other people disappoint you, get in touch with your inner self and ask it what you want to do next.

> Adults will have negative opinions about you and everything you do. Let Them judge. Let Them react. Let Them doubt you. Let Them question the decisions you are making. Let Them be wrong about you.

Saying Let Them is a way for you to get in touch with your inner self. When you start to feel disappointed by another person, the unpleasantness you feel is your inner self making your sick in a desperate attempt to get your attention. This is because your inner self needs to steer you into a different direction at this moment, away from the disappointing person and toward something that will make you happy.

> Your soul has been nudging you all along in the direction that is meant for you. Every time you say Let Them, you clear all of the noise and distraction on the surface and create space for something deeper: your voice, your intuition, your truth, and your unique path in life. It’s always been there. It’s just been buried beneath all this fear. As you use the Let Them Theory to free yourself of the burden of other people’s opinions, you’ll begin moving through life with your values, your needs, and your goals as your road map. Instead of anticipating what other people might think, you’ll navigate your life in a way that makes you proud of yourself.

## Is following someone else's formula cheating? 

No, formulas exist to people to follow. You're not cheating the world out of what would've been your unique contribution to it had you not used the formula. Even when you use a formula, you make your contribution your own. Your uniqueness comes through in your work whether or not you use a formula. Using a formula simply makes it more likely to succeed.

> Let Them think you copied them. Because you did. And they copied the formula from someone else. Because they did. Formulas exist because they work time and time again. You will make it unique because you will be putting yourself into the formula. Do not reinvent the wheel. Follow the formula and use it to your advantage.
