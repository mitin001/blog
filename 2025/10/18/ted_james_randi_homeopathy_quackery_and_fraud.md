# [James Randi: Homeopathy, quackery and fraud](https://www.ted.com/talks/james_randi_homeopathy_quackery_and_fraud/transcript)

This TED talk was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). It answered a question about conspiracy theorists.

## Why do people resort to believing in the paranormal?

Because they're not strong or mature enough to be honest with themselves. The only way to grow is to be honest with yourself, but it is hard. Resorting to believing the paranormal is one way to continue being dishonest with yourself. _I could work through the grief of losing a loved one, or I could just never move on from the denial stage and imagine that the person never died and instead is floating around me sending me all sorts of ghostly signs_. There is a whole industry of people who specialize in feeding this death-denying fantasy.

>  They tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead -- "Hi, there" -- but they can hear the dead as well, and they can relay this information back to the living. I wonder if that's true. I don't think so, because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do, exactly the same -- the same physical methods, the same psychological methods -- and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth, to their detriment. They deceive these people, costs them a lot of money, cost them a lot of emotional anguish. Billions of dolars are spent every year, all over the globe, on these charlatans.

Mature people pay money to magicians for entertainment. Immature people pay money to psychics for deception. The tricks of the trade are the same, but the maturity level of the audience is different. A magician's act consists of harmless fun whereas a psychic's act will be exploitative and predatory. Choose wisely.
