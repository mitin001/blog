# [UTC−05:00](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9205:00)

This Wikipedia article helped me during [travel](../../../2025/10/18/travel.md). It answered two questions about the time zones that capture three airports: MSP, CUN, and MID.

## When are the MSP and CUN airports in the same time zone? 

In the summer. CUN (Cancún) is in the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, which is in the UTC-5 time zone year-round, but MSP (Minneapolis-Saint Paul) is in UTC-5 only in the summer (when it observes daylight saving time).

Suppose you're flying out of MSP in the winter. If upon landing in CUN your watch says it's 5 PM, it is actually already 6 PM in CUN.

## When are the MSP and MID airports in the same time zone?

In the winter. MID (Mérida) is in the Mexican State of Yucatán, which is in the UTC-6 time zone year-round, but MSP is in UTC-6 only in the winter (when it is in standard time).

If you fly to CUN from MSP in the winter with the intention of driving to Yucatán, you will not need to adjust your clock once you reach your destination.

If you fly to CUN from MSP in the summer and then cross into Yucatán when your watch says it's 5 PM, it is actually still only 4 PM in Yucatán.
