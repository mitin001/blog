# 11-10. Why I Like Writing About Economists

This section of the book *[When to Rob a Bank (2015)](../../../2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md)* answered a question about morality vs. economics. This is similar to the old question about morals vs. ethics. Both morals and ethics are rules of conduct. The difference between them is that ethics are universal whereas morals are personal.

## What is the difference between morality and economics?

> Morality represents the way that people would like the world to work, whereas economics represents the way it actually does work.

Morals are the rules one would like the world to follow, and economics deals with the rules the world actually follows. Everyone wants the world to follow their rules, but it actually follows no one person's rules. The laws of nature, the laws of the markets, the laws of supply and demand care not for any one person's will.
