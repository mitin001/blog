This section of the book *[When to Rob a Bank (2015)](../../../2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md)* answered a question about tooth decay.

## What is effective against tooth decay?

Not with toothpaste. Use antibacterials or just don't let your mouth dry out. When SSeven Dubner talked to his dentist Dr. Reiss, the dentist let the blogger in on a secret: toothpaste will neither save you from tooth decay, nor will it whiten your teeth.

> Toothpaste is such a bogus product. Any claims that toothpaste makes about preventing decay, whitening teeth, etc., are totally fallacious, Dr. Reiss told me, because the FDA can’t and won’t allow the ingredients necessary to perform those chores in an over-the-counter product that children can easily get hold of. (That’s why he recommends an antibacterial product like Gly-Oxide, a fairly foul-tasting but apparently effective means of killing the bacteria that cause decay.)

If you want longer-lasting teeth, then kill decay-causing bacteria (not with toothpaste) or just don't let your mouth dry out. Your saliva will do the job for you.

> Tooth decay in general, even among wealthy patients, is getting worse and worse, particularly for people in middle age and above. The reason? An increased reliance on medications for heart disease, high cholesterol, depression, etc. Many of these medications, Dr. Reiss explained, produce dry mouth, which is caused by a constricted salivary flow; because saliva kills bacteria in the mouth, a lack of it means increased bacteria, which leads to increased tooth decay.

Add tooth decay to the long list of adverse events caused by medications. There's no magic pill. If you can survive without pills, do so for as long as possible. Dr. Reiss' recommendation of using Gly-Oxide for the clearance of tooth decay bacteria should be treated with the same kind of caution. Gly-Oxide is a broad-spectrum antiseptic, and as such, it will decimate the bacterial populations in the mouth, including the commensal bacteria that already crowd out the tooth decay bacteria naturally. So, if you want less tooth decay, just encourage your saliva production and the proliferation of oral nitrate-reducing bacteria.
