# 10-04. I’m a High-End Call Girl; Ask Me Anything

This section of the book *[When to Rob a Bank (2015)](../../../2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md)* answered six questions about the commodification of sex from the perspective of a high-end prostitute.

## What is sex positivity?

It's the antithesis of the old traditions that found virtue in chastity, abstinence, and resistance to indulgence.

> I have never attached my self-worth to some idea of virginity or monogamy.

## How does one become a high-end escort?

It's not street prostitution; it's not something one can be forced into, and it's not a profession that's chosen deliberately. A woman gets paid for sex once. Then, she does it again. And again. Eventually, she makes it into a side gig. And then, she decides to quit her day job and just do prostitution for a living, especially if she needs to stay home to care for her family.

> If I just had one appointment a month, I could pay my car loan with it, and have a little extra money. Eventually, I chose to work as an escort exclusively. At that time, the reason I gave up my programming job was the free time. I was caring for a family member with a serious illness—the free time and money was a huge benefit.

## Is there a database of people who buy sex from prostitutes?

Yes, these are kept by verification companies prostitutes use to stay safe on the job.

> These companies do the verification of the client and put them in a database so that when the client wants to meet with a girl for the first time, he doesn’t have to go through the verification process again. For a fee, I can call in and they will tell me if the client has a history of giving the girls problems, where he works, and his full name.

In other words, there is a cottage industry of identity verification services made specifically for the prostitution industry, and that's who's entrusted with personally identifiable information of the johns.

## When a prostitute is asked if she wants her daughter to follow in her footsteps, how does she answer?

Probably diplomatically.

> Like any parent, I would always want more for my child than I had for myself.

Asking such a question betrays the judgemental attitude on the part of the one asking it. A prostitute who likes her job is much less likely to be this judgemental, even when it comes to her adult child.

> If I had a child, I would hope that they would feel empowered, and have the opportunity to do whatever they desire to do, and that they would be in charge of their own sexuality.

## If a man caught with a prostitute says that this was the only kind of psychotherapy that worked for him, should we dismiss this statement as him offering a flimsy excuse for his immoral behavior?

Not necessarily. Everyone has their own personal set of morals, and many consider prostitution to be moral. In such context, seeing a prostitute can be equated to seeing a therapist, says a prostitute.

> If the social and legal ramifications were gone, I think that being an escort might be like being a therapist.

The prostitute notes many points of similarity between therapists and prostitutes: the pay, getting to know a stranger intimately, favoritism, etc.

> Like most escorts, a therapist sells his or her skills by the hour. A therapist also has to meet people for the first time not knowing who is walking in the door. Many have their own offices and work alone. In addition, the session is generally private and requires discretion. I imagine that many times therapists have patients that they like and some they don’t. A therapist’s revenue, like almost all other occupations, probably increases if the client feels that the therapist likes them.

## How should the government solve the problem of prostitution?

Stop criminalizing it and redirect the funds to helping prostitutes to either leave the profession or support them in the way they've chosen to make a living. Many prostitutes are addicted to drugs. Many are forced into the profession. The resources currently allocated to arresting prostitutes will be more effective if they're redirected into rehabilitation and battered women's programs.

> Instead of spending time and finite resources on arresting and criminalizing these women, we should spend our resources on making sure that these women have other opportunities and a place to go for help. The women who don’t want to be prostitutes shouldn’t have to be, and they should be able to get the help they need. Women who want to be should be able to.
