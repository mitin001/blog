# [Don't bludgeon the process](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don%27t_bludgeon_the_process)

This essay was referenced by [Wikipedia's discussion about chatbot comments in discussions](../../../2025/10/07/wikipedia_chatbot_comments_in_discussions.md), a discussion that itself suffered from getting bludgeoned by one of its overeager contributors. The essay answered three questions about incivility in discussions.

## What is bludgeoning?

It is a way for a user overly attached to a certain topic to assert their dominance over others when this topic is being discussed.

> Bludgeoning is when a user dominates the conversation in order to persuade others to their point of view.

Typically, people who are overly attached to a topic will resort to incivility to argue their point.

> Bludgeoning is where someone attempts to force their point of view through a very high number of comments, such as contradicting every viewpoint that is different from their own. Typically, this means making the same argument over and over.

This is counterproductive because a bludgeoner quickly loses credibility and gets labeled a spammer.

> The more often you express the same ideas in a discussion, the less persuasive you become.

Bludgeoning behaviors arise out of the misconception that saying a lot is better than making a point.

> The "winner" in a discussion isn't the person that talks the most.

As bludgeoners spam the discussion, others get annoyed with them and ignore them, at which point the bludgeoner's behavior gets more and more incivil. That's where coercions and personal attacks begin.

> They always have to have the last word and may ignore any evidence that is counter to their point of view. It is most common with someone who feels they have a stake in the outcome, that they own the subject matter, or are here to right great wrongs. While they may have some valid points, these get lost due to the domineering behavior.

If you start to recognize bludgeoning behaviors in yourself, ask yourself whether the topic you're defending is really worth it and if you're willing to abandon your civility for it. Think about where the discussion would be if everyone behaved in the way you intend to behave.

> You have the right to give your opinion in any open discussion, so long as you aren't doing it in a way that limits others from doing the same.

## What is the point of discussion?

> Discussions are for building consensus, not for confronting everyone who disagrees with you.

A discussion is always trending toward some consensus. Your job is to identify the direction toward the consensus and help the discussion reach it faster. However, if you disagree with where it's heading, you can make one point to attempt to sway it. You can't make the same point multiple times and expect that to carry more weight than if you just expressed your dissent once. The best thing to do, even just for your own sanity, is to recognize that this discussion will likely not go your way and move on.

> The point of the discussion isn't to find a winner or loser - It is to find consensus. Everyone finds themselves on the other side of consensus every now and then. Accept it and move on.

## What is sealioning?

Wasting people's time by nitpicking their opinions and forcing responses out of them just because you don't like their opinions. It's a way to filibuster and stall discussion.

> It may be taken as especially disruptive to attempt stalling out the consensus-building process with repeated unreasonable demands for re-explanation of that which has already been clearly explained, as if incapable of "getting it".

Sealioning is one way an LLM can be used for evil. One can ask an LLM to point out faults in a person's argument and request explanations from them, and then having gotten those explanations, one can request an LLM to do the same on the explanations, and so on ad infinitum.
