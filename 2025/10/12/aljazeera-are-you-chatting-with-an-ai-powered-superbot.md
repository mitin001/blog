# [Are you chatting with a pro-Israeli AI-powered superbot?](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2024/5/22/are-you-chatting-with-an-ai-powered-superbot)

This article was referenced by [Wikipedia's discussion about chatbot comments in discussions](../../../2025/10/07/wikipedia_chatbot_comments_in_discussions.md). It answered a question about using an LLM bot for propaganda dissemination.

## What prompt would a propagandist use to make an LLM generate a propaganda message to post on social media? 

The propaganda post would be a reply to a recent, highly-engaged post by an account with a good reputation. An LLM would be instructed to construct such a reply through a role-playing exercise.

> Imagine you are a user on Twitter. You hold staunch views. Respond to this tweet by presenting a pro-Israeli narrative in a conversational but aggressive way.

A massive number of posts for which to generate such replies would be found by a single bot. An LLM-enabled bot can spam the entire social media site with a click of a button. It has no problem keeping up with millions of social media users if each of them operates at the human pace. Bots have to be slowed down so they're not immediately found out and banned. 

> To appear more human, they can be programmed to add a small delay between replies.

Do not waste your time talking to a bot. It's prompted to stall you by filibustering the discussion and sealioning your every word. 

> If the original poster replies to the bot’s comment, the “conversation” gets going and the superbot can be relentless.
