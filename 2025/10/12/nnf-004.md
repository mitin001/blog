Knowing this film's authors' penchant for embedding interviews into the film as if they were originally collected by the host when in reality they're from other films, this is almost certainly from an archival material, probably from Kosmopoisk or Enio. It's presented to us as an interview with a victim of the Loch Ness monster or something like that.

Description from *Необъяснимо, но факт*:

> Бросно доледникового происхождения. Глубина его достигает 120-160 метров. Это одно из самых глубоких озёр в Европе. Дно его неоднородно изобилует глубокими впадинами, карстовыми пещерами. Существует гипотеза, что 400 миллионов лет назад в морской воде происходил процесс разрастания и отмирания живых организмов, интенсивно использующих для строительства своих оболочек кальций. Отмершие оболочки опускались на дно и накапливались. Так образовывались пещеры.

Translation:

> It is of post-glacial origin. Its depth reaches 120-160 meters. It is one of the deepest lakes in Europe. Its bottom is uneven, abounding in deep depressions and karst caves. There is a hypothesis that 400 million years ago, living organisms that intensively used calcium to build their shells grew and died in the sea water. The dead shells sank to the bottom and accumulated. This is how the caves were formed.

## Is there interesting original footage in *Необъяснимо, но факт: 4. Озеро безумия*?

A paleontologist digs out an egg. There is a similar scene in *The Making of Walking with Dinosaurs (1999)* but in reverse: the egg is being buried in the sand. A similar scene of the hatching of the egg is in *Walking with Dinosaurs Special: The Ballad of Big Al (2000)* and [How did life begin?] from [Harun Yahya].

## Does the film *Необъяснимо, но факт: 4. Озеро безумия* fairly describe what it depicts?

No, it mixes original and archival footage to tell unbelievable and often untrue stories. Some archival footage can be traced to its source, where the description of what it depicts will often stray significantly from its description in the [voiceover] of the film.

> Много веков назад варяжский князь решил спрятать на Бросно свои сокровища. Он приметил небольшой остров и поплыл к нему на лодке. Вдруг над водой появилась ужасная голова. Больше князя никто не видел. В 1237 году Бросня перепугала войско Батыя, которое шло на Новгород. Татары остановились на Бросненском берегу на отдых и отправили коней на водопой. Воины, спустившиеся с ними к воде, погибли. Из озера вынырнуло чудовище и съело несколько человек. Захватчики перепугались так, что на Новгород не пошли. Они решили, это дурная примета. Славянские боги гневаются.

Translation:

> Many centuries ago, a Varangian prince decided to hide his treasures on Brosna. He spotted a small island and sailed to it in a boat. Suddenly, a terrifying head appeared above the water. No one ever saw the prince again. In 1237, Brosna frightened Batu's army, which was marching on Novgorod. The Tatars stopped on the Brosna shore to rest and sent their horses to drink. The soldiers who went down to the water with them were killed. A monster emerged from the lake and ate several people. The invaders were so frightened that they did not go to Novgorod. They decided it was a bad omen. The Slavic gods were angry.

> Бросненский монстр может жить в Тверской области. Правда, в этом случае он должен быть не один. Чтобы какая-то группа животных, относительно крупных, сохранилась на протяжении большого промежутка времени, миллиона лет, или десятков миллионов лет, необходимо, чтобы в популяции вот в этой группе было достаточно много особей, сотни, может быть тысячи, иначе происходит генетическое вырождение. И тогда, если мы считаем, что в этом озере кто-то живет, то это не одно должно быть животное, их должно быть много.

> The Brosno monster may be living in the Tver region. However, in this case, there must be more than one. For a group of relatively large animals to survive over a long period of time, millions or tens of millions of years, there must be a sufficient number of individuals in the population, hundreds or perhaps thousands, otherwise genetic degeneration will occur. And so, if we believe that someone lives in this lake, then it must not be a single animal, there must be many of them.
