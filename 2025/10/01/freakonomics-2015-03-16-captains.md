## What is the difference between perfection and excellence?

Perfect is the maximum performance level possible. Excellence is the maximum performance level of the individual.

> 100 percent effort in all you do.

You can't attain perfection, but you can attain excellence.

## Why is it a bad idea to pick the cheapest flight?

Cheapest flights are more dangerous.

> Analogy: you are told you need a quadruple bypass. Now you search the Internet for the cheapest price you can get, and you rush to schedule the operation because there are only two dates that you can get that cheap rate. Do any of us do that? No. What do we do? We get second opinions, we ask who is the best in town, etc. We ask: “Is there anyone who has been doing this surgery for the last twenty to twenty-five years?” We don’t say, “Let me use someone who just graduated from medical school and was rushed through residency because it will be cheaper.” Why not apply the same logic that the public uses to buy an airplane ticket to this surgery scenario?

It's unethical to buy the cheapest tickets.

> Did you know that these regional crews can work for twelve to thirteen hours every day, flying five to eight legs a day, but their airline does not feel it’s important enough to provide food for them? They are already on welfare wages, and now they have to find time and money while on the ground for twenty-five minutes to simply nourish themselves. It’s a sad state of affairs. Remember, you bought the cheapest ticket.

It perpetuates an exploitative system.
