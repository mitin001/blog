# Необъяснимо, но факт

A Russian television series full of fragments of other films and cool background music. I pay no attention to the content (it is mostly conspiracy theory-level nonsense). Instead, I allow myself to be mesmerized by the montage and the music. The beautiful voices of the host and narrator sing along to it. It's a treat for your eyes and ears. This was on TV when I was little. I grew up on this stuff.
