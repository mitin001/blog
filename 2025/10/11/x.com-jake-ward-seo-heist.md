This post was referenced by an [article on the proliferation of LLM bots on Twitter](../../../2025/10/10/abc.net.au-twitter-x-bot-problem.md). It answered a question about the spammers' methods.

## How do spammers steal traffic from websites?

By building similar sites and gaming SEO to get their clones to rank higher. Spammers no longer have to duplicate a website to steal traffic from it. They just need to get the page titles or even just the URLs if they're descriptive enough. Then, an LLM generates the text to fill each page. Apparently, search engine, and with them, legitimate users are falling for this, and the useless AI clone of a legitimate website siphons traffic away from it.

> We pulled off an SEO heist using AI. 1. Exported a competitorâ€™s sitemap. 2. Turned their list of URLs into article titles. 3. Created 1,800 articles from those titles at scale using AI. 18 months later, we have stolen: 3.6M total traffic. 490K monthly traffic.
