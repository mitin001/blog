This article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article about the firehouse of falsehood](../../../2025/10/24/wikipedia_firehose_of_falsehood.md). It answered a question about methods of informing the public.

## Is debunking myths an effective format for informing the public?

No, do not repeat myths, even in the context of debunking them. Human cognition is vulnerable to the illusory truth effect.

> Repeating a lie, even to refute it, can help ingrain a false claim rather than dispel it.

Instead, confidently present true statements that contradict myths without naming them. Do not say "it is a myth that vaccines are unsafe." Say "vaccines are safe." A true statement resonates better than a negation of a falsehood. Humans will sometimes miss a negation, and their takeaway will be the falsehood, especially if they've encountered it before, presented as the truth.
