# [Firehose of falsehood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firehose_of_falsehood)

This Wikipedia article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article about Gish galloping](../../../2025/10/21/wikipedia-gish-gallop.md). It answered a question about propaganda.

## How to run a propaganda campaign? 

Find a connection between two concepts that could cause a strong emotion in people. For example, some types of radiation cause cancer, and 5G is a type of radiation, so one could create a false message that 5G causes cancer and then spread that message widely. One must create tons of propaganda material related to this message to match the amount of literature on the safety of 5G. This way, the public that's getting firehosed with falsehoods about 5G will have a difficult time finding the truth about it or determining what is true and what was a deliberately planted falsehood. The goal is that only the propagandist knows the truth.

> The propaganda network RT America began a "firehose of falsehood" campaign to convince Americans that 5G phones were a health hazard, even as Putin was ordering the launch of 5G networks in Russia.
