# 16. The More You Rescue, The More They Sink

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered two questions about supporting an adult or child going through life's difficulties.

## How to help someone who's struggling?

Do not rescue them. Their struggle may seem easier to you simply because you're not struggling. Be patient with them, allow them to rescue themselves.

> In your attempt to help, you may unknowingly be preventing other adults from finding their strength to face their struggles. The more you try to rescue someone from their problems, the more likely they will continue to drown in them. Allowing someone to face the natural consequences of their actions is a necessary part of healing. The fact is, adults only get better when they are ready to do the work, and you will be ready way before they are.

People who are struggling need emotional support. A grief shared is a grief halved. However, providing emotional support is not the same as saving them from the struggle. They must go through it. You are there just to cheer them on as they're doing it.

> In times of struggle, what the other person needs is acceptance. Let Them struggle. People only heal when they are ready to do it for themselves. These are deeply personal, difficult battles. . . and they can only be fought by that person when they’re ready to fight. You cannot make them fight. You cannot make them get sober. You cannot make someone financially responsible. You cannot make them heal. Yes, they need your love and support. But here’s the hard part: They do not need to be “rescued.”

Do not enable people with handouts. No one appreciates things they didn't earn. Let people work for the things they want in life.

> The more you judge someone for their behavior, the better they will get at lying to you about it. It’s imperative that you realize that rescuing someone isn’t supporting them, and enabling someone’s self-destructive behavior isn’t loving them. There is a thin line between what constitutes support, and what is enabling people. Enabling is when you justify or support someone’s problematic behaviors because you think you’re helping them. For example, it can include things like giving money to an adult child who is not using it responsibly and is not looking for a job. It can look like covering for people because they were out drinking last night, making excuses for your spouse’s anger, or ignoring the problem to avoid conflict. Often, loving someone will require you to let them learn the hard way.

It's easier to go through growing pains when there's a person by your side cheering you on. Be that person for someone.

> Helping others doesn’t mean solving their problems for them—it means giving them the space, support, and tools to do it themselves.

Don't be the person to take away someone's pain. That's the way life teaches us to grow into the people we want to be. Pain is a necessary condition for building a fulfilling life.

> There is a huge difference between trying to make someone’s pain go away and offering support that allows them to do the work themselves.

Because people are conditioned to avoid pain, it's so hard for them to change their behavior or learn their failures.

> If it’s easier to avoid the problem, they will never face it.

This is why people need someone to nudge them toward going through the painful experience: so they can emerge from it stronger and wiser. By going through with solving a problem, one becomes a person they've always aspired to be—one who can not just set goals but also achieve them.

## How to teach a child to sleep in her own bed?

Tuck her into bed, wait for her to fall asleep, and then go to bed yourself, in your own room. If the child wakes up in the middle of the night and pleads with you to let her sleep in your bed, take her to her own room, to her own bed. Be kind and supportive. Do this as many times as it takes. Eventually, the child will get used to sleeping in her own bed. She will overcome the struggle she thought was insurmountable. Your job is not to backslide into enabling her maladaptive behavior or rescuing her from whatever monsters she thinks inhabit her bedroom. In this chapter, Mel Robbins sets an example for how to do this. She recounts her personal struggle with getting her child to sleep in her own bed.

> She would wake up again and come down again, not once but a few more times, and I would take the time to comfort her, put my arm around her, and walk with her back up those stairs to help her face what she was avoiding. Look at people’s struggles as an opportunity to support them in discovering their strengths. If someone learns that they are too weak to face their struggles, they will never experience what is truly possible. And if you always swoop in and rescue someone, they will start expecting you to do it when life gets hard. But if they see themselves moment by moment, day by day, facing the hard and scary things in life with you by their side, you teach them that they are capable of doing things that are way beyond what they see for themselves. Stop rescuing people from their problems and start acting as if you believe in their ability to face them. Your actions are the loudest and truest form of communication. So when you act in a way that supports someone in facing what scares them, your behavior says, “I believe in you. You can do this. And I’ll be here by your side as you face it.” Supporting people through struggle is very hard to do. It is draining. It takes a lot of time and patience. It is frustrating. That is why a lot of us resort to enabling or rescuing people.
