# [Body Language Expert Explains How to Show Confidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRJzvJ5XPQI)

This video was recommended to me by [YouTube](../../../2025/10/17/youtube.md). Its [transcript](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=f5f5a2ac37440854442200c3dccf97a8) answered a question about a quality that is to be emulated: confidence.

## Why do leaders never appear to be in a rush?

> The temporal aspect of leadership. If you're in charge, you're in charge of time. I'm going to take my time to walk out. I'm going to take my time to answer your question. I will answer it in the pace, manner, and tone that I choose. And in doing that, we are demonstrating that we are confident and in control.

Confidence is the most important skill. People will want to follow you if you project confidence. One way to do so is to command time. Confident people reject the notion that time commands them. They do not rush as they speak. They allow themselves to make pauses while speaking.

> Pauses make people listen.

Unrushed speech punctuated with pauses is more interesting to the listener. It elicits respect from the listener.

> If you want people to listen to you, use cadence to get their attention, hold their attention, but then look forward to what that next set of words will be. It lets them know at a subconscious level, this is the person in charge. And we know that they're in charge because they have temporal control over this. They're not in a hurry.

The moment you start to feel rushed or jittery, slow down and center yourself. Preening behaviors take away your confidence. These behaviors repel people.

> The person in charge has the time to look up at their own pace. The gestures are smooth. There's no hesitation. There's no quick movements. There's no jitteriness. There doesn't have to be. I'm in charge. When I feel less confident, I feel like I have to be in a hurry, that I've got to look up and I've got to answer right away. And there's a lot of preening behaviors and these are detracting from me.

One way to center yourself and regain confidence is to lean into a wall to release muscle tension and broaden your shoulders. The body will recognize the posture of confidence and start behaving confidently.

> I find a good solid wall and I will just lean into it like I'm holding this wall up, pressing against it just as if I were doing a push-up. And one of the things that that does is it releases a lot of muscular tension. And because I'm doing it very wide, it makes me feel more powerful and I need to walk on that stage as though it's mine. With full confidence, it is only then that I look at my audience.
