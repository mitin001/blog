# 7. When Grown-Ups Throw Tantrums

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered five questions about dealing with emotional responses in yourself and others. This chapter is [longer](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=8b1296c39aebc88ce03dd9c531f2393f) in the audio book.

## What is the difference between child and adult emotions? 

It depends on how mature the adult is. Some throw the same kinds of temper tantrums children throw. Others learn to channel their frustrations into venting, rage texts, and other maladaptive behaviors. Few know how to deal with their emotions without inflicting them on other people.

> Adults, at their core, are just as emotional as children. The difference is, they are better at hiding it. . . most of the time.

By observing a frustrated adult, you can assess their maturity level. If they act like children, they've not matured at all. If their behavior is different from a child's but just as coercive, then their development went in the wrong direction.

Know that most people are like that, so frustrating situations are best to be avoided.

> Just assume that most adults have never learned how to process their emotions in a healthy way, because no one’s parents knew how to do this either, and if yours did, then you are one lucky person. A child cannot learn how to do this on their own.

Emotional immaturity is a generational problem.

> Growing up, you were probably taught to repeatedly repress what you feel. When you tell a child to “get over it” or “stop crying” or “calm down,” you are training them to suppress how they feel. To distract, avoid, or numb these normal human emotions.

Very few people of the previous generation knew how to correctly parent their children, which is why so many people of this generation need help with their mental health.

> That is why so many people live with anxiety, depression, addiction, or chronic pain—because they have avoided all the emotions over the years that then build up inside of them without any outlet.

## What to do when a child throws a temper tantrum?

Let them cry it out. They must learn to process their emotions in a healthy way. Be compassionate, but don't try to shut them up by giving into their emotional coercions.

> Help the child process the emotions that they’re feeling in a calm, understanding, and compassionate way. That might look like bending down and saying, “I know this is hard. I know you want the Lego set. It’s okay to be upset. I get disappointed too. It’s not fair. I get upset when I don’t get the things that I want.” Let Them cry, beg, or do whatever they need, for as long as they need. If kids are not allowed to experience the full wave of emotion (without an adult saying “calm down,” or “this is silly,” or “you’re overreacting”), they never learn how to process normal human emotions in a healthy way. Instead, they become an emotionally immature adult who takes it out on the rest of us.

Mel Robbins admits that she would do whatever it took to get her children to stop crying. This left her children emotionally stunted.

> All three of my children now need therapy because I didn't teach them how to regulate their own emotions. In fact, I made them feel bad about the emotions that they were feeling.

## What to do when an adult throws a temper tantrum or acts emotionally immaturely?

Pretend you're talking to a child. This will allow you to feel compassion for them.

> Most adults are just eight-year-old children inside of big bodies. The next time you’re with this person and you feel yourself getting triggered by something they say or some way that they act, I want you to just imagine the fourth-grade version of them present in the room with you. Because what you’re describing is someone who has the emotional maturity of an eight-year-old. And, like it or not, that’s most adults.

However, you don't need to help them out of their tantrums. They must find their own way out of them.

> It’s your responsibility to help a child create space to process their own range of emotions. But it is not your responsibility to manage another adult’s emotional reactions.

You don't need to immerse yourself into someone's temper tantrum to feel empathy for them.

> Show more compassion for other people from a safe distance.

Realize that since this person is not actually a child, it is not your responsibility to help them process their emotions. If someone continues to behave like a child into their adulthood, it's unlikely they'll ever stop behaving like a child. You can't help them.

> It’s never your job to manage another adult’s emotions. When someone pulls the silent treatment on you, or plays the victim, or erupts in frustration, Let Them. And then I want you to visualize an eight-year-old trapped inside their body. When you do that, something wild happens. You don’t feel scared of this person. You actually pity them. You feel compassion instead of contempt. You will also realize that their inability to process normal human emotions like sadness, insecurity, disappointment, anger, fear, and rejection is not your fault. And it’s also not your problem to solve. This has been happening to this person since they were a child. It is not your responsibility to manage their emotions or try to fix them. Your responsibility is to protect yourself from their emotional spiral, and to see it for what it is: A person who has no idea how to handle or express their emotions in a healthy way. Let Them go silent. Let Them erupt. Let Them play the victim. Let Them sulk. Let Them deny that it happened. Let Them make it all about them. Then, Let Me. Let Me be the mature, wise, and loving adult in this situation. Let Me decide if I want to address this directly or not at all. Let Me remind myself that managing another person’s emotions is not my job. Let Me remove myself from any text chain, dinner table conversation, relationship, or friend group where this is happening. Instead of expecting other people to change, demand the change of yourself. Hold yourself to a higher standard and stop allowing this type of emotionally immature behavior to be your responsibility to manage. Stop staying in situations where someone’s repeated emotional immaturity is starting to feel more like abuse. Stop feeling sorry for people who play the victim all the time. Stop explaining away someone’s clearly narcissistic patterns. The more time you pour into a relationship with someone who acts like an eight-year-old, the more you’re going to feel like a parent to a child. When you recognize that you are dealing with someone who has a lot of internal work to do, you can draw healthier boundaries around the amount of time and energy you are willing to give to them. Because until this person does the work to build the skills of emotional intelligence, they will always pull the silent treatment, play the victim, or be passive aggressive. This isn’t a personality trait, it’s a pattern.

Focus on living your life, not being stuck in another adult's never-ending temper tantrum.

> The way that people learn how to start to deal with their emotions is by you not rescuing them from those emotions.

## Why do adults sometimes give each other the silent treatment? 

Cowardice and emotional immaturity. The silent treatment is an attempt at an emotional coercion.

> An immature adult uses the silent treatment because they don't know how to process their own emotions. And so they go silent and just drop this guillotine and cut off all contact because they hope you're gonna come over to them. They want you to ask what's wrong so that they don't have to deal with their emotions by themselves.

Emotionally immature people don't communicate their emotions with words. They rely on an emotional contagion. They try to get you as upset as they are, and tactics like giving you the silent treatment is just that.

> When somebody gives you the silent treatment, it's because that feels easier than having an honest conversation and share how you're feeling.

## What to do when you feel a physiological stress response rising up in your body?

Do not react to it. You're not able to think clearly in this state. Do not make any decisions that require careful deliberation. You're not able to deliberate in this state. Let your body process the stress response in peace.

> When you feel your emotions rising up, Let Them. Allow the anger, the frustration, the hurt, the disappointment, the sadness, the grief, the tears, and the feelings of failure to come up. Let Them. And then, Let Me not react. Don’t reach for your phone. Don’t turn on the TV. Don’t make a drink. Don’t open the fridge. And for crying out loud, don’t text anyone. Just notice the feelings and Let Them rise up. The reason why you must learn how to Let Them rise is that once they do, they also fall.

The stress response can arise instantaneously and it can subdue very quickly, too. If you don't feed it, your body naturally extinguishes the stress response within 90 seconds.

> Emotions are just a burst of chemicals in your brain that ignite and are absorbed into your body within six seconds. Because your emotional reactions happen so fast, they can often be completely unconscious. You may first notice your emotions through the physical sensations that accompany the chemical burst, such as sweating, muscle tightness, or a racing heartbeat. Research shows that most emotions will rise up, and then fall away, within 90 seconds, if you don’t react to them. You cannot control your emotions from rising up. Trying to is a waste of your time. The better strategy is learning to just Let Them rise up and then fall without reacting.

If you're observing another person experiencing a physiological stress response, do not try to help. They must learn to leave it alone on their own. Just like you must learn to leave other people alone.

> There is also nothing you can do that will ever allow you to control the emotional reactions in another human being, no matter how hard you try.
