This episode of [Pivot](../../../2025/10/14/pivot.md) answered a question about the meaning of life.

## Why must life be hard?

Because if it was easy, it would be boring.

> The greatest yeses in your life involve one thing: a shit ton of no's.

If all you feel is joy, then you can't feel any joy. It has to be against the backdrop of adversity and hard work. Scott Galloway reminds us of this lesson, as it was illustrated by _The Twilight Zone_.

> Remember that episode where this guy, this criminal is shot, and he goes to heaven, and he's in heaven, and every woman he approaches says yes and wants to date him. And when he goes up to the blackjack table, it's blackjack every time. And there's huge lines to get into the hottest restaurants, and they're like, _right in this way, sir_. And he starts getting sick of winning all the time. And he says, _come on, guys, this is supposed to be heaven_. And the guy turns and goes, _my brother, this is not heaven_. That's the point.
