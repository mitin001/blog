## What is elegant variation?

Elegant variation is something SEO-obsessed or poor writers do to puff up their prose with a new synonym every time they write a new statement about their subject.

> Pope Paul waved from the balcony. As the Supreme Pontiff raised his hand, it became apparent that the Holy Father's glove had a large black stain, causing great embarrassment to the Bishop of Rome.

The text is annoying to read, and it is bad writing. 

> It can confuse readers who are unaware, for example, that the Pope is the Bishop of Rome. It fails to fix the real cause of repetitive prose, which is usually repeated information, not repeated words. In other words, elegant variation treats the symptom and not the cause.

Suppose you write a sentence and discover that it repeats words. 

> Sarah and Louise went to a supermarket, where Sarah bought Louise an ice cream.

You may be inclined to replace the repeated words with synonyms. 

> Sarah and Louise went to a supermarket, where the former bought the latter an ice cream.

This is a poor strategy. The sentence should've just been rephrased in a way that wouldn't have repeated words in it. 

> At a supermarket, Sarah bought Louise an ice cream.

In other cases, one could just use pronouns, as the English language intends.

> This presumably emerges from an attempt to avoid repetition. But the English language already has a solution for repetitive nouns: pronouns (he / him / she / her / they / them / it). When a pronoun isn't clear, just use the original word. In 99% of cases, the result is perfectly natural.

People who resort to elegant variation think they're being clever, and their text is more interesting to read because it keeps the user guessing.

> It can create the impression that the identity of the person or thing being referenced is unknown. It makes the reader work harder to keep track of who or what is being discussed, sometimes requiring them to reread text â€“ or forcing them to guess.

Such writers may think that if their reader can't solve their little riddles, then such readers don't deserve their writing. This is a poor attitude to adopt. Elegant variation doesn't keep the reader engaged; it does the opposite.

> It's no great riddle, but it's distracting and obfuscates information to no advantage.

It's called elegant variation in jest. Elegant variation is an antiphrasis: it is everything but elegant.

> The English lexicographer H. W. Fowler coined "elegant variation" as an ironic criticism of this strategy.
