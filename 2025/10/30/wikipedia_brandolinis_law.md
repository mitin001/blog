# [Brandolini's law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law)

This Wikipedia article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on sealioning](../../../2025/10/20/wikipedia-sealioning.md). It answered a question about LLMs.

## Why does it take more time to write with an LLM than without it? 

Because fact-finding is easier than fact-checking. An LLM predicts words in a sentence that make sense statistically. Sometimes, they also make sense semantically, but not always. Therefore, every statement made by AI must be fact-checked. Alberto Brandolini expressed that fact-checking is a much more time-consuming process than we realize.

> The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.

Frédéric Bastiat expressed a similar sentiment.

> Our adversaries have a marked advantage over us in the discussion. In very few words they can announce a half-truth; and in order to demonstrate that it is incomplete, we are obliged to have recourse to long and dry dissertations.

The adversaries of truth, i.e., bullshitters, now have a powerful tool for churning out vast amounts of bullshit. Do not become one of them. Prioritize facts.
