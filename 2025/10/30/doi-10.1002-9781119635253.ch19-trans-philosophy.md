# [Public Philosophy and Trans Activism](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119635253.ch19)

This scholarly article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on sealioning](../../../2025/10/20/wikipedia-sealioning.md). It answered three questions about violations of academic standards that seem to be tolerated based on the social privilege of the person violating them.

## Why does every academic paper begin with the background section? 

To show that the author is building on existing research and is making every effort at advancing the field from that point on, rather than repeating observations that have been already made or simply providing his own hot takes on the matter. The latter has been done in philosophy papers where an individual would put out work simply to advance one's credibility within the field rather than the field itself.

> Done without proper background, accountability, and epistemic hygiene, this sort of “open season” theoretical speculation reduces the philosophical project to an exercise in generating hot takes: the ability to position oneself as a philosopher and to represent one’s output as philosophy can be used to lend weight and credibility to whatever pops into one’s head, even if one knows nothing about the topic and one’s arguments are not especially novel or sophisticated.

Unfortunately, to inject one's opinions in the public discourse, one could publish a philosophy paper without considering any background on the subject. One could sneak it past the overtaxed peer-review system of prestigious journals or into less magazines that don't require much rigor.

> Activities like “public philosophy” can provide distinctive cover for those wishing to pass off hot takes as profound insights or authoritative declarations.

A mere association with the discipline lends legitimacy to the claims the larger body of the discipline may not support. When philosophers with greater expertise on the subject expose holes in the argumentation (of the opinions that shouldn't have been given any legitimacy in the first place), this often does not even discredit them. Because it came first, the uninformed opinion counts more than its informed rebuttal.

> When philosophers do “public philosophy” about marginalized or othered groups, they have extraordinary latitude to say whatever ill-informed thing pops into their heads without compromising the perception that they are thoughtful, qualified, and impartial commentators. Indeed, much current anti-trans activism is simply masquerading as “public philosophy” to gain an undeserved patina of respectability and intellectual coherence. Moreover, careful expert responses to these “hot takes” are treated with a double-standard of heightened scrutiny and lack of charity given to the arguments made.

Any serious philosopher would welcome a critical evaluation of his work by those with expertise on the subject.

> If we attend to your work closely enough to engage in angry, detailed criticism, don’t take this as a rejection, crankiness, disordered ranting and raving, or the effects of testosterone poisoning. It’s a *gift*.

## How to ask a question without being accused of JAQing?

Include supporting evidence for why the answer might be "yes" and take responsibility for the question. Research your question first (you have access to the entire repository of human knowledge, after all), and include what you've learned in your question. Facilitate the ensuing debate in good faith. Otherwise, you can easily slip into JAQing, which is a tactic trolls use to sneak falsehoods into the minds of the public: by posing them as innocent-looking but bad-faith questions.

> “Just asking questions” allows one to recenter the conversation on a view one wishes to advance without having to provide supporting evidence or argument or to take responsibility for the consequences of one’s positions. In this respect, it is akin to (or perhaps a form of) insinuation.

Transphobic philosophers use the JAQing tactic in bad faith to try to drive their trans colleagues out of academia.

> Transphobic philosophers and their enablers insist on the importance of the freedom to ask uncomfortable and politically incorrect questions without any sort of accountability and proceed to use that freedom to ask loaded, propagandistic questions full of derogatory insinuations about us as trans people, but they are unwilling to grant us the same freedom if we are interested in using it to ask questions about what the fuck is wrong with them.

Transphobic philosophers ask inflammatory, propagandistic questions and then label those philosopher who disagree with the premise "activists", thereby dismissing at the outset their credentials and extensive knowledge on the subject.

> Cases like these expose the way the “philosopher”/“activist” dichotomy serves as a tool of epistemic oppression – the categories are so ill-defined that it becomes trivial to situate those one wishes to defend and promote as “philosophers” and to write off those one wishes to ignore and marginalize as “activists,” without regard for any legitimate or even consistent diagnostics of professionalism, objectivity, rigor, or expertise. This double standard can even lead to explicitly philosophical work of established trans philosophers being ignored as mere activism.

Meanwhile, transphobic philosophers are allowed to ignore contributions of trans philosophers and continue spreading their anti-trans propaganda as they continue to ask their bad-faith questions.

> This low bar for acceptable academic standards seems only to apply to cis researchers writing on trans topics, able to actively ignore the work of the very trans people they’re treating as objects of study and comment. Trans people, then, are something to be written about but not treated as worth reading or as sources of knowledge: we are objects to be known, not knowers and experts.

## What is sealioning?

> A conversational tactic that uses repeated bad-faith questions to derail and exhaust one’s interlocutors.

Trolls now feed people's comments into LLMs and prompt them generate questions, which they then paste into the discussion. When the person posts his responses to those questions, the trolls goes right back to the LLM for more questions, prompting it with the responses to the previous questions. The LLM can keep generating questions forever, but the patience of the human responder can run out very quickly. This is why LLM-generated text and tactics like sealioning must be recognized and called out on the spot and the trolls using them should not be engaged with beyond that point.
