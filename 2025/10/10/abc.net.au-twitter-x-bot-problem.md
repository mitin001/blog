# [Twitter is becoming a 'ghost town' of bots](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2024-02-28/twitter-x-fighting-bot-problem-as-ai-spam-floods-the-internet/103498070)

This article was referenced by [Wikipedia's discussion about chatbot comments in discussions](../../../2025/10/07/wikipedia_chatbot_comments_in_discussions.md). It answered four questions about AI slop spammers.

## What is the most bot-infested social network? 

As of February 2024, Twitter (X), by far.

> Over three days in February, cybersecurity firm CHEQ tracked the proportion of bot traffic from X to its clients' websites. It found three-quarters of traffic from X was fake, compared to less than 3 per cent of traffic from each of TikTok, Facebook and Instagram.

## Why are there so many LLM-generated comments on Twitter?

It's a quick way to create a Twitter account with a good reputation, so it can then be resold to the highest bidder with an agenda to sell a product or spin a narrative. Every comment will peel off a few likes from legitimate users and get followed by other similar bots, thereby building up its reputation.

> It's just trying to recruit followers and write content that will age the fake accounts long enough to sell them or use them for another purpose.

The higher the numbers of comments, likes, followers, and days active, the higher the chance the account won't get flagged once it starts pushing an agenda.

## How should Twitter combat its bot infestation?

Any time an account posts an obvious tell from ChatGPT, it should be deactivated on the spot. It takes no time for an LLM-using bot to overrun Twitter and bury it in its grey goo of slop, so the reaction must be just as swift.

If a legitimate user posts an obvious ChatGPT tell, they should be able to get their account back after going through an appeals process that a bot wouldn't be able to go through.

## What is an obituary pirate?

An AI slop scammer specializing in obituaries. Apparently, there's a market for this stuff.

> "Obituary pirates" are using AI to create YouTube videos of people summarising the obituaries of strangers, sometimes fabricating details about their deaths, in order to capture search traffic.
