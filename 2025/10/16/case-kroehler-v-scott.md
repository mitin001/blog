# [Kroehler v. Scott](https://www.cetient.com/case/kroehler-v-scott-1494964)

This case was referenced by [State v. Limberhand](../../../2025/09/29/freakonomics-state-v-limberhand.md). It answered a question about the Fourth Amendment rights.

## Is it legal for a police officer to collect evidence of potential criminal activity by conducting an ongoing surveillance of a toilet stall from the ceiling vent?

No, any evidence collected from surveillance without probable cause would be inadmissible. Officers can only violate privacy of a suspected criminal if they have probable cause: they saw that the person entering the stall was carrying drug-related paraphernalia or invited a likely sexual partner to join them.

> Should a law enforcement officer observe an individual enter the stall with drug-related paraphernalia or what appears to be such, his immediate surveillance of the stall in the manner here followed appears warranted. Similarly, when two individuals enter the stall, neither of whom appears to be an invalid or handicapped as to require assistance, the immediate surveillance of the stall, without the delay incident to a warrant appears to pass Constitutional muster.

The fact that criminal activity is known to happen in a given toilet stall is not probable cause. The probable cause test must be applied to each new occupant of the stall individually. If there is no probable cause, the surveillance cannot legally begin.

> Upon receipt of complaints of homosexual activity, two "spy pipes" were installed in the roof of pay toilets in a privately owned amusement park. At the owner's request two police officers perched on the roof to peer through the pipes and observe the conduct of the occupants "until we make an arrest, or until we see that we can't make an arrest". The Court suppressed evidence thus gathered on the ground that the "search" of the unknown occupants was not predicated upon probable cause.

Surveillance like this is counterproductive. It wastes a lot of police time on collecting evidence that would be inadmissible in court. In Kroehler v. Scott, it was discovered that police has made 20 arrests from such a surveillance practice, none of which should have been prosecuted.

> In response to complaints of homosexual and drug-related activity occurring in the public men's room at the Penn Central Railroad Station and at Long Park, both in Lancaster, initiated a program of surveillance designed to enable the defendants to apprehend persons involved in these criminal activities. As part of this program, holes were drilled in the ceilings directly above the toilet stalls to allow the defendants to peer covertly into the stall below and observe, unnoticed, whatever transpired. These clandestine observations were conducted intermittently during the period from January 10, 1974, to May 13, 1974 (Penn Central Station) and from August 3, 1973, to April 1, 1974 (Long Park) at times of most frequent use for a duration of one to two hours, but up to as much as seven hours. Defendants never sought a warrant or obtained judicial authorization prior to conducting any of this surveillance, which has resulted in approximately twenty arrests.

Unfortunately, ten of those arrested illegally did not know their rights and volunteered for criminal charges and repercussions.

> Ten (10) of those persons arrested as aforesaid, have pleaded guilty as charged and paid fines and costs imposed.

This was unfortunate because it showed the police officers that they could violate the law to make arrests and still expect such arrests to stick. The Fourth Amendment does not seem to be as powerful a deterrent of such behavior as it was intended to be.
