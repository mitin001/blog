# 1. Stop Wasting Your Life On Things You Can't Control

This chapter of the book [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md) answered a question about happiness, relationships, and control issues.

## How to be happy? 

Stop setting expectations for other people.

> Other people hold no real power over you unless you give it to them.

Most of the unhappiness in your life comes from your disappointment in other people. Hell is other people.

> So much time and energy is wasted on forcing other people to match our expectations. And the truth is, if somebody else—a person you’re dating, a business partner, a family member—if they’re not showing up how you need them to show up, do not try to force them to change. Let Them be themselves because they are revealing who they are to you. Just Let Them and then you get to choose what you do next.

Live your life free of worrying about what others do. If you don't set expectations for other people, they can't miss them.

> The more you let people be who they are, or feel what they feel, or think what they think, the better your relationships will be.

To try to change someone or force them to meet your expectations is to go against human nature. Other people cannot be controlled, but your need to control them can be managed safely in your own head.

> No matter how hard you try, you will never be able to control or change another person. The only person you are in control of is you. Your thoughts, your actions, your feelings. For too long you’ve been working against this fundamental law of human nature. You’ve been fighting to change people, battling to control situations, worrying about what people say, think, or do; and in doing so, you’ve created unnecessary stress, tension, and friction for yourself and in your relationships.

When you stop imposing your expectations on other people, you get to recoup the time and energy you would've spent stewing in your disappointments and use it for something productive.

> When you stop trying to control things that aren’t yours to control, you stop wasting your energy. You reclaim your time, your peace of mind, and your focus. You realize that your happiness is tied to your actions, not someone else’s behavior, opinions, or mood.

The author Mel Robbins now accepts human nature as it's meant to be accepted and invites you to follow her example.

> Instead of resisting the natural flow of human nature, I learned to embrace it. Instead of wasting my energy on something I can’t control—what others say, think, and do—I poured my energy into what I can control: me.
