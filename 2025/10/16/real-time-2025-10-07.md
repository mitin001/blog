This episode of [Real Time](../../../2025/10/16/real-time.md) answered a question about Trump.

## What is Trump's best quality?

His confidence. Trump is the ultimate con man. He uses his confidence to get away with things no one else could get away with. He comes right up to the limit of acceptable behavior, crosses that line, and lures others on the other side. Speaking coarsely is acceptable for Presidents now. Using the justice department to go after your enemies is allowed now. Ignoring checks on the executive branch is the new normal.

> There are just so many things that we thought were laws that are just norms. And Trump has really highlighted that, _you know, geez, I thought there was a law against firing someone from the Fed_ or _I thought there was a law against all these things that he does almost every day_. They were just norms. And when you bust through them, it's hard to get them back.

Yes, Trump uses his best quality mostly for evil, but it is still his best quality.
