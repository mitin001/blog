# 6. Tails, You Win

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered a question about chasing success.

## How to find success? 

Find a way to immerse yourself in everything. If one of your ventures ends up being extraordinary, then you will be successful. That's how venture capitalists (VCs) operate. They invest in everything, and if one of their investments pays off in a big way, it covers all the others. Success is about finding that outlier.

> If a VC makes 50 investments they likely expect half of them to fail, 10 to do pretty well, and one or two to be bonanzas that drive 100% of the fund’s returns.

These are known as tail events, as in the tails of normal curves in statistical distributions. The tails capture the outliers.

> Long tails—the farthest ends of a distribution of outcomes.

Tail events drive the economy.

> A small number of events can account for the majority of outcomes.

The economy is a selector of extraordinarily successful tail events.

> Tails drive everything. The distribution of success among large public stocks over time is not much different than it is in venture capital. Most public companies are duds, a few do well, and a handful become extraordinary winners that account for the majority of the stock market’s returns.
 
Within a vast sea of companies, there's an extraordinary one. How does it get to be so extraordinary? It finds a way to invest in a multitude of ideas, one or two of which turn out to be extraordinary. It's a grain of genius surrounded by layers upon layers of filler.

> In 2017, Amazon drove 6% of the S&P 500’s returns. And Amazon’s growth is almost entirely due to Prime and Amazon Web Services, which itself are tail events in a company that has experimented with hundreds of products, from the Fire Phone to travel agencies. Apple was responsible for almost 7% of the index’s returns in 2017. And it is driven overwhelmingly by the iPhone, which in the world of tech products is as tail-y as tails get.

Tails drive what makes it into the news.

> There is the old pilot quip that their jobs are “hours and hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.” It’s the same in investing. Your success as an investor will be determined by how you respond to punctuated moments of terror, not the years spent on cruise control. A good definition of an investing genius is the man or woman who can do the average thing when all those around them are going crazy. Tails drive everything.

Even the genesis of life on Earth was a tail event.

> There are 100 billion planets in our galaxy and only one, as far as we know, with intelligent life. The fact that you are reading this book is the result of the longest tail you can imagine.

Understanding this and applying it to finance will lead you to financial success. If your investment portfolio is set up in such a way that a tail event can pay for all other investments, then continue investing without fear as you wait for the tail event.

> An investor can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune. It means we underestimate how normal it is for a lot of things to fail. Which causes us to overreact when they do.

Art dealers understand this. They buy up entire portfolios of art because they know that the chances of encountering at least once extraordinary work in the sea of the output of human genius is high.

> The great art dealers operated like index funds. They bought everything they could. And they bought it in portfolios, not individual pieces they happened to like. Then they sat and waited for a few winners to emerge. That’s all that happens. Perhaps 99% of the works someone like Berggruen acquired in his life turned out to be of little value. But that doesn’t particularly matter if the other 1% turn out to be the work of someone like Picasso. Berggruen could be wrong most of the time and still end up stupendously right.
