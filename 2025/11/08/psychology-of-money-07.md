# 7. Freedom

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered a question about happiness.

## How to be happy? 

Do not squander your life on trying to outearn somebody else. Find a range of interests and dedicate adequate time to them all. Learn from your elders.

> Karl Pillemer interviewed a thousand elderly Americans looking for the most important lessons they learned from decades of life experience.

No one regrets a missed financial opportunity on one's deathbed.

> No one—not a single person out of a thousand—said that to be happy you should try to work as hard as you can to make money to buy the things you want. No one—not a single person—said it’s important to be at least as wealthy as the people around you, and if you have more than they do it’s real success. No one—not a single person—said you should choose your work based on your desired future earning power. What they did value were things like quality friendships, being part of something bigger than themselves, and spending quality, unstructured time with their children.

Money is a means to an end. It must be earned so you can have the freedom to be with your loved ones. Once you have that freedom, you don't need to outearn anyone else. Money cannot be an end in itself. Making it such well make you miserable.

> “Your kids don’t want your money (or what your money buys) anywhere near as much as they want you. Specifically, they want you with them,” Pillemer writes. Take it from those who have lived through everything: Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.
