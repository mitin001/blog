# 8. Man in the Car Paradox

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered a question about exterior signs of wealth.

## Went should you buy nice things? 

Not to signal your wealth to others. You won't inspire admiration. You will inspire jealousy.

> You might think you want an expensive car, a fancy watch, and a huge house. But I’m telling you, you don’t. What you want is respect and admiration from other people, and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. It almost never does—especially from the people you want to respect and admire you.

Buy nice things only if you want them for yourself. Only if you will use them when no one is looking. If you're buying them to tout your wealth, you will be hated.

> When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, “Wow, the guy driving that car is cool.” Instead, you think, “Wow, if I had that car people would think I’m cool.” Subconscious or not, this is how people think. There is a paradox here: people tend to want wealth to signal to others that they should be liked and admired. But in reality those other people often bypass admiring you, not because they don’t think wealth is admirable, but because they use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired.

If you want to be loved, just be a nice person. The extent of how much people care about the things you have is that they want them for themselves.
