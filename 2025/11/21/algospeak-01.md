# 1. How to Play Linguistic Whac-A-Mole

This chapter of [Algospeak](../../../2025/11/20/algospeak.md) answered ten questions about the digital age from the point of view of a linguist.

## How long do we have before America becomes a surveillance state?

It already is. We are already living in a surveillance state because our online platforms are watching everything we do. This is evidenced by Internet users consistently finding new ways to weasel out of the algorithm (and the interests behind it) from noticing them doing anything they may not like. This includes using of certain words (e.g., terms for genitalia) or even approaching certain subjects (e.g., Palestine). This is why we sometimes get recommended bait-and-switch content. The algorithm got fooled into classifying content as something trendy and uncontroversial while the video is actually about a topic that's inconvenient to the platform.

> The creator is knowingly critiquing the algorithm at the same time as they acquiesce to it. Many pro-Palestine creators will start out their videos with an unrelated topic or a pro-Israel sentence before baiting and switching into their views on the conflict. This is intended as a wink to the audience, reminding them that the platform is always listening. In a way, the same is true for all of traditional algospeak: Even the eggplant emoji doubles as a metalinguistic reminder that your content had to pass through a layer of algorithmic perception.

In a surveillance state, we all must play the game of linguistic whac-a-mole.

> Whac-A-Mole truly is the perfect metaphor for explaining how humans react to censorship. As soon as a word is banned, we find a way around it; that is, until content moderators catch wind of the new word and ban that, too. Then another word pops up, and the cycle repeats, trapping users and platforms in a never-ending loop of new spellings and substitutions that disappear once the algorithm catches on and the mallet comes down again. The faster and better the moderation tools are, the more words will be created. This is because the underlying idea—and our desire to talk about it—remains. People have been playing this game since the early days of the internet. Frustrated with text filters on bulletin boards in the 1980s, netizens turned to “leetspeak,” a hacker dialect characterized by creatively respelled words. Since terms like “suicide” were censored in some chat rooms, leetspeakers wrote out coded replacements like “5U1C1D3”.

## When designing a content-filtering system, why is it a bad idea to simply flag every corpus of text containing a match from a list of swear words?

Because you may step into the Scunthorpe problem.

> Named for an English village where residents discovered they were unable to create AOL accounts because their hometown contained the word “cunt.”

A text classifier cannot rely solely on substring matching. If such a system relies on search, then it must at least be semantic search.

## Why does one keep encountering words like _btch_ and _fvck_ all over social media (misspelled swear words)?

Thanks to bowdlerization, which is a way to avoid attempts by those in power to make the space overly family-friendly.

> If you look up the keyword “bitch” through TikTok’s search function, for example, you’ll likely encounter variations such as “btch,” “b!tch,” and “b*tch” in the video captions. Same with “fuck,” which will probably give you “fck,” “fvck,” and “f*ck”—none too different from the leetspeak letter substitutions of the past. The practice of respelling offensive words is a centuries-old tradition known as bowdlerization, named for the Englishman Thomas Bowdler, who is mainly remembered for publishing some egregiously family-safe edits of William Shakespeare’s plays.

Bowdlerization can also be helpful in educational contexts that discuss offensive words. The author who finds himself in such circumstances must go out of his way to ensure that no offense was intended.

> The word “fascist” is etymologically related to the “f-slur for gay people.”

Bowdlerization helps clarify which word the author is talking about.

> F*ggot.

## Are the words _pen_ and _pencil_ related?

No, the word _pen_ isn't related to the word _pencil_, but it is related to the word _penis_.

> “Pencil” actually traces to the Latin word penis, meaning “tail”—and, yes, that’s also the source of the English word “penis.”

## Why does one keep encountering words like _seggs_ and _nip nops_ on social media?

They are a common way to make one's speech more palatable in a silly way (_seggs_ refers to _sex_, _nip nops_ refer to _nipples_, etc). They are called **minced oaths**.

> Euphemisms created by slightly altering the spelling or pronunciation of offensive words. We’ve been mincing our oaths forever: That’s why we say “heck” instead of “hell” or “gosh” instead of “God.” Much like “peen,” these words sound like a less intense version of what they represent, making them more palatable to easily offended audiences. We still understand what the words mean, but they lack the shock value to really upset societal sensibilities. Minced oaths can also involve replacing entire phrases. In late 2021, the chant “Let’s Go Brandon” served as a MAGA minced oath for the words “Fuck Joe Biden.” Is that really so different from using “kermit sewerslide” instead of “commit suicide”? Both allude to more serious phrases through phonetic similarity, both became popular through their PG silliness, and both spread beyond meme status.

A minced oath is part of a sociolect, a language dialect used to distinguish between the insiders and outsiders of a given social group. Every social group has its own sociolect, from individual families tosocial media users as a whole. Just as social media users of today have learned to speak algospeak, early Internet users had leetspeak.

> The earliest online sociolect, indicating belongingness to an elite group of internet-savvy users.

When people move from one group to another, they code-switch to a different sociolect.

> When a frat bro addresses another frat bro in frat-speak, the communication is seamless, because it fits the social context. But imagine if Chad told Brad he was bringing “alcoholic malt beverages to the day party.” Chad’s meaning would still be communicated, but less effectively than if he used the words “brewski” and “darty.” It would be weird for Brad because it’s not in their shared sociolect. At the same time, Chad would be much less likely to use the word “brewski” around his grandmother. This is classic code-switching—shifting between sociolects depending on the environment. Just as it’s weird for Chad to suddenly lapse into stilted formal English when talking to Brad, it would be weird for TikTok sex educators to actually say “seggs” in real life. The context matters.

When switching from one speaker to the next, a psychological phenomenon called communication accommodation takes place.

> We’re constantly making adjustments in our language (accommodating our communication) to be more or less like the person with whom we’re interacting, because we innately try to attune to the behavior of others. Through this trial-and-error process, we determine what is and isn’t appropriate in certain domains of use.

## Is algospeak going the way of leetspeak (extinct)?

Not anytime soon. Leetspeak was the sociolect of early Internet users, whereas algospeak is the sociolect of the Internet users of today. That's everyone.

> Leetspeak had its own dynamic and was used by a much smaller group. The very reason it died out was that more people simply got on the internet, overwhelming the leet population and making h4x0rz behavior appear “cringe.” Algospeak, meanwhile, is around in a time when everyone is on the internet and using these words, not just a select few. If anything, it’s set to be around much longer and have a much wider impact than leetspeak.

Algospeak is the sociolect that seems to have passed much stricter selection criteria, as so many people agree to speak it.

> Algospeak is just the latest iteration of a human constant. Like its historical equivalents, it has a certain domain of use, undergoes code-switching, and uses modified language to evade notice by the authorities. Our new video medium both influences and reflects innate cultural patterns.

When the Internet finally undergoes technological changes significant enough to replace algospeak, it will be with a different sociolect. Language itself changes, but not the underlying mechanism for it.

## Do Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube all have distinct sociolects?

No, there's only one sociolect on short-video sharing platforms. Even though there are different algorithmic restrictions on these platforms, content creators post the same content to all three, constraining it to the restrictions of the most restrictive among these platforms. This means there's only one sociolect—TikTok's—that gets adopted by Instagram and YouTube.

> Successful creators rarely generate content for just one app, but instead cross-post to all of them, and as such try to work within the most severe algorithmic constraints (historically those on TikTok). Users, culture, and expectations will also often overlap across apps. Successful creators are usually in tune with that and make content that aligns with all at once.

## Does the emergence of TikTok and similar platforms signify the end of the human exploration of the world through literary works?

No, just the opposite. It encourages an even richer, faster-paced exploration of the world, and the merits of the work churned out by its content creators deserve just as much praise as those of the literary geniuses of the past. For example, the way Dante and Shakespeare commented on the powerful without calling them out by name in _Inferno_ and _Hamlet_ is now standard practice on TikTok, and there is even an academic term used to describe and study it: Voldemorting.

> People are deliberately avoiding keywords in the same way wizards avoid saying the name “Voldemort” in Harry Potter.

In the digital age, Voldemorting becomes a tool of resistance. It is an act of protest against those who have seized power without consent, at least from those groups they actively oppress.

> By imposing a taboo on “Trump,” or inserting an asterisk in the middle of “men,” playing into algospeak puts the linguistic narrative back into the hands of the oppressed. The act of Voldemorting can indicate a lack of respect for the subject; it can also make a statement by reclaiming the act of censorship. By not talking about Trump directly, people signal that his name is filthy, too offensive to be uttered. Language, then, becomes an act of resistance.

## Does the increased use of emojis signify the demise of our language? 

No, it signifies its rebirth. The last time we communicated with pictographs, the language soon entered a phase of significant development.

> Written language emerged from the increasing abstraction of pictographs, and now we’re looping back around.

The picture in the emoji doesn't even have to depict what you're trying to say anymore. It can simply euphemize it. For example, the corn emoji is a new stand-in for porn. This means we've already looped back around not just to simple pictographs, but euphemistic pictographs from the Roman Empire.

> Early Christians, for example, used a secret symbol called the Jesus fish to indicate their religion, since the Greek spelling of “fish” doubled as an acronym alluding to Christ. The Jesus fish was used as a signal between Christians to indicate to each other that they were in the same group, without being discovered by their Roman persecutors.

## Why do we have to keep updating which words are acceptable to use to describe people with disabilities and racial minorities? 

Because the words we used to describe them in the past become slurs over time. They get poisoned by those who hijack them for their trolling or propaganda. Before we learn to keep those people from doing that, the best solution we have is to walk the euphemism treadmill.

> The continuous motion of evasive words in the English language. The euphemism treadmill is why we’re constantly updating our words for offensive things. The words “idiot,” “imbecile,” and “moron” all used to be serious words for classifying mental disability, but then they became negative, so we replaced them with the word “retarded,” which also became negative, so we replaced that with “mentally disabled,” which is also becoming negative. The same process happens with terms for racial and sexual minorities as the words they use to describe themselves become poisoned over time. That’s why “colored” became “black,” and why some people now prefer capital-B “Black.” Once words are used maliciously, we replace them until the cycle continues, as if moving along on a treadmill. This is a normal and inevitable linguistic process that can only really be solved by addressing the underlying societal problems causing the treadmill to move in the first place.
