# 5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered a question about planning and a question about frugality.

## Why do people so often squander their wealth? 

Because getting wealthy and staying wealthy are diametrically opposite tasks. Getting wealthy requires aggressive risk taking coupled with a tremendous bout of luck. So tremendous that the person who found it misattributes it all to his genius. Staying wealthy requires frugal risk aversion coupled with a realization that you may never get this lucky again.

> The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans has, on average, roughly 20% turnover per decade for causes that don’t have to do with death or transferring money to another family member. Capitalism is hard. But part of the reason this happens is because getting money and keeping money are two different skills. Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely.

We are so obsessed with getting rich that we forget that staying rich is just as important.

> There are a million ways to get wealthy, and plenty of books on how to do so. But there’s only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia.

Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger got to keep their wealth. Rick Guerin did not.

> You’ve likely heard of the investing duo of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. But 40 years ago there was a third member of the group, Rick Guerin.

Buffett explains what caused Geurin's fall from grace. It was his attitude.

> Charlie and I always knew that we would become incredibly wealthy. We were not in a hurry to get wealthy; we knew it would happen. Rick was just as smart as us, but he was in a hurry.

## How to formulate an effective plan? 

Include a margin of safety in it.

> The most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.

Your plan should not rely on exact figures. Every figure must be a range.

> Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly right. Room for error—often called margin of safety—is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance. It comes in many forms: A frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose timeline—anything that lets you live happily with a range of outcomes. It’s different from being conservative. Conservative is avoiding a certain level of risk. Margin of safety is raising the odds of success at a given level of risk by increasing your chances of survival.

Do not avoid risk, but do include contingencies for what you can do if taking a risk leads to failure. What's the worst thing that could happen? This question must be addressed in every effective plan.
