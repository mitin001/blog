# [Situational Strategies for Self-Control](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736542/)

This academic paper was referenced by [an academic paper on critical ignoring](../../../2025/10/28/pmc7615324-critical-ignoring.md). It answered four questions about self-control.

## How to effectively exercise self-control?

Have a strategy to remind yourself of the importance of waiting or the reward at the end of it. A child was presented a dilemma: eat this cupcake right now or wait for the experimenter to come back, upon which you can eat two cupcakes. The experimenter then watched how the child struggled with self-control. Children who had a strategy showed much better self-control.

> Some children sang (e.g., “I’m waitin’, I’m waitin’, I’m waitin’”); some sat on their hands or covered their eyes with their hands; others repeated the task instructions aloud (“If I wait, I get this pile; and if I don’t wait, I get this pile.”). Only 10% of children used no strategy at all, and all 17 of these children failed to wait for the larger reward. The difference in wait time between those who used a strategy and those who did not was highly reliable.

Trade one reward for another. Only allow yourself to listen to your favorite track while you're jogging. The intent is to compel you to do something that's good for you by reserving an enjoyable activity to co-occur with it.

> Bundling rewards with long-term goals (e.g., reserving a guilty pleasure like a trashy novel for visits to the gym).

Remove yourself from the environment that places temptation in your way.

> The most effective way to do battle with our inner demons may be, in fact, by taking the battle outside of the mind.

## How is it that buying candy in individually wrapped packages is conducive to self-control?

This sort of candy cannot be consumed automatically or mindlessly.

> Opening the next box or package is a very salient cue of consumption, and this cue facilitates monitoring of an otherwise automatic indulgence.

Every time you open a package, your whole mind focuses on this activity, including the part that tells you to stop consuming unhealthy foods.

## Why do we set deadlines? 

They are precommitment devices. They motivate us to produce better results.

> The shame of not delivering on schedule will induce us to work harder and get started earlier than without an externally enforced target. By agreeing to this social contract, we increase the cost of procrastination, getting us off the couch (or our email) in order to attend to the work at hand.

## How to get through an argument with a loved one?

Detach. 

> Imagining ourselves as a third-party spectator, rather than a first-person combatant, in arguments with our spouse can preserve marital satisfaction.

Approach the situation like an anthropologist studying the art of human arguing. Make observations (silently to yourself) about the tactic your loved one is using on you to try to get their way (e.g., "she's trying to upset me so I can feel the same negative emotions she's feeling with the same intensity—emotional contagion", "she's using the silent treatment to try to manipulate me into paying attention to her", etc).
