# 2. Sticking Out Your Gyat for the Rizzler

This chapter of [Algospeak](../../../2025/11/20/algospeak.md) answered four questions about the evolution of language and discourse in the age of the algorithm.

## What is slang?

Informal speech.

> It’s something to code-switch in and out of.

Slang is a nursery for new words in a language. Working-class people spoke in slang, and the words that leaked into the upper class would become standard English.

> By the 1750s, the word “slang” emerged as a catchall term to describe the nonstandard words used by the lower classes. Around that same time, England became more connected than ever, meaning that more communities could coalesce to come up with slang. The lower classes especially felt freer to create new words since they weren’t bound by the same rules, and wider social networks helped those words spread more quickly. If the upper class eventually started using those same words too, they stopped being called slang and became everyday language.

Nowadays, slang words no longer needs approval from the upper class to catch on.

> Enter the World Wide Web, where anybody could post content for anybody else to see. Mankind finally became released from centuries under the reign of the language police, and new words sprang up from all the new corners of the internet. As early as the 1980s, internet users started making up slang like “lol” and “noob.”

The Internet has democratized the way our language is allowed to evolve. It has also sped the innovation cycle of language up to an unprecedented degree: everyone participates in the race to become an early adopter.

> After someone makes the initial decision to start incorporating a slang term into their vocabulary, they later make another decision either to continue using the term or to abandon it. This is often sociologically conditioned: As soon as the laggards start using a word, the innovators and early adopters will either begin to see it as uncool or find a permanent use for it (after which the rest of the population will follow).

## How to predict whether a new word will stick?

If it's needed, it will not fall out of use. For as long as there are parties in their current form, there will be the word for _party_ (and _function_, if you want to be humorous about it). Similarly, as the cancel culture rages on and we keep canceling people, the word _cancel_ will remain in everyday use.

> A word will stick if it serves a new role in the English language. If, as with “cancel,” it defines a necessary concept, then we say that it’s filled a semantic gap: a concept that we didn’t previously have a word for. Had there already been an entrenched word for the same idea, we would have had no need to cancel people. Sometimes, though, the new word also provides a better or funnier way to express a concept than existing synonyms, which is why “function” was able to slowly start supplanting “party”: It filled the semantic gap of a silly way to talk about social events.

## What is the origin of the word _okay_?

It used to be fashionable to abbreviate phrases the way they sounded, rather than the way they were spelled.

> In the mid-nineteenth century, there was an American slang fad to give words incorrect abbreviations, like “O.K.” for “all correct.” That was then printed in a Boston newspaper, helping it reach mainstream usage, which is how we have the word “okay” today.

## Is the algorithm constraining the discourse that takes place on social media? 

Yes, only those content creators that chase trends are allowed to succeed.

> Essentially all influencers are purposefully minimizing their own creativity in order to pander to perceived algorithmic tastes and subsequently enhance their visibility. This affects not only our choice of content but also our aesthetics, creative processes, and overall strategies.

Algorithmic tastes do not necessarily reflect those of the population at large.

> As early as the summer of 2023, people were making “rizz” content because the keyword “rizz” was trending, and the keyword “rizz” was trending because the algorithm decided that it would be so.

The algorithm can be exploited. Just as some trolls keep us all scrambling to catch up to the euphemistic treadmill (as they hijack words for marginalized groups to make them offensive, forcing us to come up with new words, and so on), others keep up on the engagement treadmill.

> As certain types of content get engagement, more creators make those types of videos, so more people engage with it, so more creators make it.
