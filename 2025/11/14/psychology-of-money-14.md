# 14. You’ll Change

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered two questions about making better decisions.

## What is the secret to happiness? 

Variety. Diversify your portfolio of life. Don't aim to be number one at one thing. It's a long, arduous, and lonely road, and there are far too many people to defeat. Instead, put your time in many buckets, and tend to them every day.

> When you consider our tendency to change who we are over time, balance at every point in your life becomes a strategy to avoid future regret and encourage endurance. Aiming, at every point in your working life, to have moderate annual savings, moderate free time, no more than a moderate commute, and at least moderate time with your family, increases the odds of being able to stick with a plan and avoid regret than if any one of those things fall to the extreme sides of the spectrum.

Just as you shouldn't obsess over making more money than everyone else, you also shouldn't completely neglect the financial aspect of your life.

> Avoid the extreme ends of financial planning. Assuming you’ll be happy with a very low income, or choosing to work endless hours in pursuit of a high one, increases the odds that you’ll one day find yourself at a point of regret.

Avoiding the extremes in general is the secret to happiness.

> The benefits of an extreme plan—the simplicity of having hardly anything, or the thrill of having almost everything—wear off. But the downsides of those extremes—not being able to afford retirement, or looking back at a life spent devoted to chasing dollars—become enduring regrets. Regrets are especially painful when you abandon a previous plan and feel like you have to run in the other direction twice as fast to make up for lost time.

## What are sunk costs?

> Anchoring decisions to past efforts that can’t be refunded.

People often make wrong decisions because of sunk costs. They reason that since they've already put so much time and/or money into something, they might as well stick it out and recoup some return on their investment, however meager or nonexistent.

> They make our future selves prisoners to our past, different, selves.

To save yourself from falling into the sunk costs trap, tell yourself that you're a different person now, and you should no longer act on the advice of the past, less informed version of yourself.

> Financial goals made when you were a different person should be abandoned without mercy.

The time and/or money you've sunk didn't go to waste. They went into making you the version of yourself that's can realize that this particular project should be abandoned. Now you can move on to better things.
