# 6. Wordpilled Slangmaxxing

This chapter of [Algospeak](../../../2025/11/20/algospeak.md) answered six questions about the way the Internet is changing our culture and society.

## Is the Internet making us ruder?

Yes, the online disinhibition effect is real.

> A phenomenon where anonymity makes it easier to spread negativity.

## Is the Internet making us more cynical?

It appears so, judging by the emergence of the incel community and the mass adoption of doomslang.

> Hyperbolically negative phrases like “everything sucks” and “I want to kill myself” have become shockingly commonplace, and everyday actions like lying in bed on your phone are bleakly described as “dissociating,” “doomscrolling,” or “bedrotting.” This kind of language is especially common among incels, who were using phrases like “LDAR” (“lay down and rot”) before “bedrotting” ever became a thing. The modern doomslang phenomenon appears to have evolved simultaneously with incel-speak, in some cases even being influenced by the latter.

Good humor gets thumbs up from lots of people, but it has to compete at the top of our feeds with depressing, controversial messages because so lots of us are also rage-baited into commenting under them.

> Depressive incel words like “cope,” “ropemaxx” (an algospeak replacement for “commit suicide”), and “wagecuck” (someone who works a mindless nine-to-five job). Meanwhile, the term “brainrot,” now used to describe a genre of Gen Alpha humor, likely also came from incel circles, which used the expression to describe the perceived decline in intelligence resulting from their lack of social interaction. These terms spread partially because the algorithm thrives on negativity and partially because they confirmed our existing cultural outlooks. Phrases like “doomer” and “it’s over” spoke to our disconnected reality, while “brainrot” held a mirror up to our online addictions and “wagecuck” reflected our growing disenchantment with the American dream. And since apocalyptic statements are good for engagement, the phrases eventually became a part of the zeitgeist, emergently reinforcing our pessimistic points of view. Words are memes, and memes are trends.

## Is the incel community a cult? 

Yes, it radicalizes a person and alienates him from his family and friends. The recruitment into the incel community happens through language and the social media recommendation algorithm. A person starts using incel vocabulary (sometimes without realizing it), gets recommended more content from the incel filter bubble (often disguised as innocent-looking memes), and falls ever so deeper into the rabbit hole.

> Within the incel community itself, language serves the same function as language in a cult: It’s a recruitment tool creating an “us versus them” mentality. Since incel vocabulary is used to mark “correct” blackpill philosophy, the incel feels alienated from normies—family and friends who don’t use the language. Meanwhile, truecel rhetoric pushes recruits to accept more extremist beliefs.

Like a cult, the incel community doesn't offer a solution to the person's problem: namely, their interpersonal struggle with low self-esteem and confidence. It's simply an echo chamber of externalizers that blame the world for their problems.

> In a perverse inversion of their initial goals, the degree of “purity” translated to higher “truecel” status. People would proudly use labels like “KHHV” (short for “kissless, hugless, and handholdless virgin”) to display their deeper connection to blackpill philosophy, just as a cult has layers of exclusivity to further draw in the acolyte.

Like a cult, the incel community has layers and hierarchies, with members incentivized to climb them.

> Incels intentionally establish their “subordinate masculine status” as a justification for their misogynistic views. By using their truecel purity to legitimize the blackpill philosophy, incels are able to argue against women’s agency by advocating for male supremacy, rape, and “sexual redistribution” policies allocating at least one woman to every man. To the incel, these options are more humane than his own existence: The Incels Wiki page explicitly argues that “involuntary celibacy is more painful for men than rape is for women.”

Like that of a cult, the incel ideology is extreme.

## What is the future of the incel community? 

There isn't one. It's death by ridicule. Most people who saw incel content didn't get roped into their cult. Once the Internet saw the incel memes, it started laughing not at the memes, but at the incels themselves.

> To most of us, these memes were just funny. We weren’t blackpilled by incel language, and we didn’t perpetuate them to promote lookism or racism or sexism. Instead, we used them as a form of dark humor, flipping the script on the incel community to ultimately satirize them. When we repurposed the “Chad versus virgin” meme template, the incels became the butt of the joke. When my friends and I used words like “-maxxing” and “pilled,” we established a new in-group: the community of young people on social media. The terms were silly jokes to connect over, signaling that we knew something exclusive about popular culture. Since everybody wanted to feel like part of the in-group, the words spread, taking them out of the incels’ hands and robbing them of their original power as they simply became “brainrot” words.

On the Internet, it's not always clear whether someone speaks sarcastically, ironically, trying to be edgy, or is actually stating their real views. That's what allows incel memes to spread: the masses reward an incel's post with engagement because it's taken by most people in jest. Meanwhile, some respond to it with curiosity and eventually get roped into the cult. The good news is that the latter happens much less frequently as the incel culture gets increasingly more exposure for what it is, and the naivete gap is shrinking quickly.

> Misery loves company; that’s why the incels in my Reddit chat were so keen on converting us.

Good luck finding anyone who wouldn't see through an incel for who he is now that his cult has seen so much exposure. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

## Is it true that all Internet culture is downstream of 4chan, as one popular aphorism holds?

Partially. 4chan was indeed a significant Internet community of early adopters of many words that managed to diffuse out into the masses: _shitpost_, _seggs_, _rickroll_, etc. 4chan is also where the incel culture started. However, one shouldn't overlook Reddit as another cradle of the Internet culture.

> In 2018, researchers at University College London used a technique called pHashing to trace where visually similar online images come from, and they found that a plurality of internet memes come from political forums on 4chan and Reddit.

4chan quickly ceased to be the dominant place for the Internet's cultural innovators.

> Most new memes by 2022 were coming from TikTok or Twitter.

## Have advertising tactics changed recently? 

Yes, it has been discovered that traditional advertising tactics don't work on younger generations (and perhaps never worked on anyone). The new advertising tactics is to use humor, rely on endorsements by peers (influencers), and hijack a meme.

> Anyone trying to push an idea or agenda today must rely on comedy. The best advertising is being done either through influencers (lending products a more organic feel) or through “unhinged” corporate accounts like Duolingo’s, which openly leans into the meme that its mascot will hurt you if you don’t complete your daily lesson.

Problematic communities (like incels or QAnon) have grown to such troubling numbers because they successfully injected their messages into funny or unhinged/subversive memes on social media sites.

> These communities are so prolific at disseminating ideas because they intentionally weaponize memes as a form of “attention hacking,” mixing funny templates with certain messages to further their ideologies.
