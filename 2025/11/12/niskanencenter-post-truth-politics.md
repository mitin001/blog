This article was referenced by [an article on totalitarian propaganda tactics](https://www.openculture.com/2017/01/hannah-arendt-explains-how-propaganda-uses-lies-to-erode-all-truth-morality.html), which, in turn, was referenced by [an article on resilience to misinformation](../../../2025/11/03/edsurge-recalibrating-our-approach-to-misinformation.md). It answered three questions about bullshitters.

## What is the difference between a liar and a bullshitter?

A liar knows the truth but conceals it, whereas a bullshitter does not know the truth but pretends that he does.

> The liar or the fraud knows that there is a truth of the matter, and aims to deliberately conceal it. Neither is true of the bullshitter, who is making noise for some purpose that is orthogonal to the truth. Sometimes it is to make an impression as a knowledgeable authority, in which case the bullshitter does at least want to create the impression that there is a truth of the matter and that he knows it.

## Why do we participate in the bullshittification of our shared reality? 

Because it's entertaining. Bullshitting has long been a component of circus performances. Loud pronouncements that purposefully misrepresented the performers to enhance their cred in the eyes of the audience made the show more fun.

> Not only is the speaker unconcerned with the truth of the speech, but everyone knows this. The whole thing is done with a wink and a nudge, as much as a carnival barker’s narration about the performers. Maybe the trapeze artists really are twins; maybe they really are from Italy. But neither fact matters at all for whether the barker says those things; the barker is just going for patter that sounds good. And the audience knows that, and doesn’t care; it’s all part of the show.

Now we expect everyone to be talking themselves up to a sickening degree, and we actively cheer them on. Look at any post on LinkedIn. It was only a matter of time before the likes of Donald Trump would rise up to lead this country off a cliff. We got the president we deserve.

## Why does Trump lie about trivial, verifiable things like his crowd sizes?

Because that's his litmus test for who will defend him no matter what he does. That's how he identifies enablers.

> A leader with authoritarian tendencies will lie in order to make others repeat his lie both as a way to demonstrate and strengthen his power over them. Saying something obviously untrue, and making your subordinates repeat it with a straight face in their own voice, is a particularly startling display of power over them.

Every dictator (or wannabe-dictator) surrounds himself with enablers to complete the authoritarian takeover of government and make his rule stick. 

> Being made to repeat an obvious lie makes it clear that you’re powerless; it also makes you complicit. You’re morally compromised. Your ability to stand on your own moral two feet and resist or denounce is lost. Part of this is a general tool for making people part of immoral groups. One child makes a second abuse a third. The second then can’t think he’s any better than the first, the bully, and can’t inform. In a gang or the Mafia, your first kill makes you trustworthy, because you’re now dependent on the group to keep your secrets, and can’t credibly claim to be superior to them.

Even though the practice of a litmus test is a well-researched, well-documented authoritarian tactic, that's not why Trump is engaging in it. Making others repeat his lies is just a part of his personality. Our descent into authoritarianism is organic.

> Donald Trump understands this instinctively, and he relished the power to make his subordinates repeat his clearly outlandish lies in public. Every Sunday he provided fresh absurdities that Chris Christie, Rudy Giuliani, and Kellyanne Conway repeated on the talk shows.

Trump's enablers have no political future. They will never reach as far as he has. Their blind desire to be on the inside is a clear display of their powerlessness.

> Making his surrogates repeat the lies compromised them; that tied them to him. And it degraded them, and made clear where power lay.
