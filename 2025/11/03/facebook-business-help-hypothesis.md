# [Choosing a hypothesis to test on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2358258211160819)

This Facebook help article was referenced by [Facebook's help article on A/B testing](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1738164643098669), which, in turn, was referenced by [an academic paper on critical ignoring](../../../2025/10/28/pmc7615324-critical-ignoring.md). It answered a question about market research.

## How to conduct market research? 

Use the scientific method. First, formulate a testable hypothesis, proving or refuting which will advance your market research.

> A video format performs better than a carousel format when reaching my audience about new products.

This is a divide-and-conquer strategy on a large, complex problem of market research.

> It turns a complex business objective—growing your audience's consideration of your new product—into a specific scenario that can be answered directly by an experiment that compares both ad formats to prove or disprove the statement. A test exists that can answer the question effectively, in this case an A/B test. It can be answered with metrics that are specific to the conditions of the test, such as the number of clicks each ad receives for a similar number of impressions.
