# [Recalibrating Our Approach to Misinformation](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-12-19-recalibrating-our-approach-to-misinformation)

This article was referenced by [an academic paper on critical ignoring](../../../2025/10/28/pmc7615324-critical-ignoring.md). It answered two questions about resilience to propaganda.

## What is the degree of gullibility required of the citizenry for an authoritarian takeover of their government to succeed?

No gullibility is required. What is required, however, is a high degree of cynicism.

> The breeding ground of authoritarian movements is not belief, but cynicism. In a world where nothing can be known and all producers of knowledge are seen to be compromised, there is no truth, only power.

If no one trusts the experts, and the truth is unknowable, the citizenry welcomes a dictator who would tell them what to believe.

## How to defeat disinformation? 

Not with your critical thinking skills. Rather, you need critical ignoring skills. Know where to direct your attention.

> The goal of disinformation is to capture attention, and critical thinking is deep attention. It would be comforting to think that when you engage deeply and earnestly with neo-Nazi literature or tobacco-company research that you come out more informed, provided you note all the logical traps and rhetorical fallacies. In reality, whenever you give your attention to a bad actor, you allow them to steal your attention from better treatments of an issue, and give them the opportunity to warp your perspective.

Recognize propaganda for what it is early and often, and turn your attention elsewhere.
