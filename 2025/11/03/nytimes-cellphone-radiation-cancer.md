# [Study of Cellphone Risks Finds ‘Some Evidence’ of Link to Cancer, at Least in Male Rats](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/health/cellphone-radiation-cancer.html)

This article was referenced by [an article on 5G misinformation](../../../2025/10/31/nytimes-5g-phone-safety-health-russia.md). It answered a question about the link of pre-2G cellphones to cancer.

## How to grow a tumor in a biological organism with a cell phone?

One study was able to successfully do that. The experimenters used rats and a radio frequency emitter similar to a 1990s cellphone.

> The rats were exposed to radiation at a frequency of 900 megahertz — typical of the second generation of cellphones that prevailed in the 1990s, when the study was first conceived.

The emitter consistently emitted 1-4x the maximum allowed emission of radiation from the 1990s cellphones.

> The lowest level of radiation in the federal study was equal to the maximum exposure that federal regulations allow for cellphone users. That level of exposure rarely occurs in typical cellphone use, the toxicology agency said. The highest level was four times higher than the permitted maximum.

The emitter was on for nine hours per day.

> The rodents in the studies were exposed to radiation nine hours a day for two years — far longer even than heavy users of cellphones.

Malignant gliomas grew in the brains of 2-3% of the male rats, and malignant schwannomas grew in the hearts of 5-7% of the make rats.

> For the rats, the exposures started before birth and continued until they were about 2 years old. Some 2 to 3 percent of the male rats exposed to the radiation developed malignant gliomas, a deadly brain cancer, compared to none in a control group that received no radiation. Many epidemiologists see no overall rise in the incidence of gliomas in the human population. The study also found that about 5 to 7 percent of the male rats exposed to the highest level of radiation developed certain heart tumors, called malignant schwannomas, compared to none in the control group.

The widespread adoption of cellphones essentially replicated this study on the human population, but with significantly lower RF emissions acting for far shorter bursts of time than 9-hour stretches every day. These caveats seem to be sufficient safeguards that have protected the human populations from developing these tumors. Keep in mind also that rodents have much thinner skulls than humans. A [different article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/health/cell-phones-cancer.html) also pointed out that the tumors did not develop in female rats or mice, either, so there might be something else that's predisposing male rats to suffer more from the radiation. Perhaps, it's their larger size (hence more radiation absorbed).
