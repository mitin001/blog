# 2. Luck & Risk

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered five questions about luck and risk.

## How to find success?

Expose yourself to as much life has to offer as possible. In other words, give yourself the opportunity to stumble into good luck. However, when stumbling around you may encounter risk and not luck. The trick is to do your best to avoid risky situations while looking for the lucky ones.

> Every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort.

Those forces are luck and risk, and they can be (and often are) more consequential than anything else you might do to get ahead in life.

> The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take.

You're not as in control of how the world responds to your actions as you might think or wish. There are too many variables and moving parts there.

> The world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes.

## Can one learn to be successful? 

To a point, yes, but do not use profiles of extremely successful people as your examples of what to do. Also, do not use case studies of extreme failures in the news as examples of what not to do. Extremely successful people are accidents of luck, and extremely devastating circumstances are accidents of risk. If you want to learn to be successful, study the formulas moderately successful people follow to find their success. If you follow the same formula, it's a safer road to moderate success. With some luck, you may even stumble into great success.

> Studying a specific person can be dangerous because we tend to study extreme examples—the billionaires, the CEOs, or the massive failures that dominate the news—and extreme examples are often the least applicable to other situations, given their complexity. The more extreme the outcome, the less likely you can apply its lessons to your own life, because the more likely the outcome was influenced by extreme ends of luck or risk. You’ll get closer to actionable takeaways by looking for broad patterns of success and failure. The more common the pattern, the more applicable it might be to your life.

Stories of extremely successful people dominate the media, but they are outliers and thus are of little value when it comes to finding a formula one can actually follow to find similar success.

> The cover of Forbes magazine does not celebrate poor investors who made good decisions but happened to experience the unfortunate side of risk. But it almost certainly celebrates rich investors who made OK or even reckless decisions and happened to get lucky. Both flipped the same coin that happened to land on a different side. The dangerous part of this is that we’re all trying to learn about what works and what doesn’t with money. What investing strategies work? Which ones don’t? What business strategies work? Which ones don’t?

We chalk up lucky decisions to genius and unlucky ones to idiocy, but in reality, those are simply the forces of luck and risk at play. And yet, it's comforting for some to think that the richest man has made his fortune because he possesses wonderbrain that will next save humanity.

> We similarly think Mark Zuckerberg is a genius for turning down Yahoo!’s 2006 $1 billion offer to buy his company. He saw the future and stuck to his guns. But people criticize Yahoo! with as much passion for turning down its own big buyout offer from Microsoft—those fools should have cashed out while they could! What is the lesson for entrepreneurs here? I have no idea, because risk and luck are so hard to pin down.

There is no wonderbrain, especially not among the wealthy, an enterprise dominated by luck and risk.

## Is it a good strategy to break the law in your pursuit of success? 

No, even as history books are replete with counterexamples.

> Cornelius Vanderbilt had just finished a series of business deals to expand his railroad empire. One of his business advisors leaned in to tell Vanderbilt that every transaction he agreed to broke the law. “My God, John,” said Vanderbilt, “You don’t suppose you can run a railroad in accordance with the statutes of the State of New York, do you?”

Similarly, AI companies today create AI models out of illegally obtained copyrighted works, and their outputs themselves can violate copyright. This is why Disney is suing Midjourney, some book authors are pursuing legal action against OpenAI, etc. AI companies, brazen in their contempt for the law, are our present-day Cornelius Vanderbilt.

> That attitude is why he was so successful. Laws didn’t accommodate railroads during Vanderbilt’s day. So he said “to hell with it” and went ahead anyway. Vanderbilt was wildly successful. So it’s tempting to view his law-flouting—which was notorious and vital to his success—as sage wisdom. That scrappy visionary let nothing get in his way! But how dangerous is that analysis? No sane person would recommend flagrant crime as an entrepreneurial trait. You can easily imagine Vanderbilt’s story turning out much different—an outlaw whose young company collapsed under court order.

The counterexamples to the norm that only law-abiding citizens get to keep their wealth are misleading. Extremely successful people who got there by breaking the law stumbled into the kind of luck one should not be betting on. It is far safer to find your luck playing by the rules of the system. If you're playing with risk, one misstep could cost you dearly.

> If you acknowledge that luck brought you success then you have to believe in luck’s cousin, risk, which can turn your story around just as quickly.

Bill Gates warns that being successful is not the same as being invincible, a lesson successful people often forget.

> Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.

## What is a good investment strategy? 

Make consistent, unemotional, long-term investments. Leave room for failure.

> The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your financial life in a way that a bad investment here and a missed financial goal there won’t wipe you out so you can keep playing until the odds fall in your favor.

The stock market is the opposite of a casino. The house doesn't always win on the stock market. The investor always wins. You just have to play long enough to get the return on your investment.

## How to forgive yourself for a bad decision? 

Understand that every decision comes with risk, and sometimes it's worth it to make risky decisions. If one risky decision led to a bad outcome, that's simply your price for playing the game. Pay the price and move on.

> The role of risk means we should forgive ourselves and leave room for understanding when judging failures. Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.
