# [The Secret Symbol Neo-Nazis Use to Target Jews Online](https://www.mic.com/articles/144228/echoes-exposed-the-secret-symbol-neo-nazis-use-to-target-jews-online)

This article was referenced by [an article on bracketing](../../../2025/10/26/theguardian-echoes-triple-brackets.md). It answered a question about video editing.

## What can a video/audio editor do to present someone in a derisive way?

Play a cartoonish sound effect every time their name is mentioned by the narrator. The sound effect can even just be an added echo to the segment of the audio track where the narrator utters the name. This was what an antisemitic podcast did in their attempts to deride the Jews.

> The Daily Shoah featured a segment called "Merchant Minute" that gave Jewish names a cartoonish "echo" sound effect when uttered.

Unfortunately, the motives for their derision were rooted not in comedy but in offensive propaganda of xenophobia.

> Jewish surnames echo throughout history. In other words, the supposed damage caused by Jewish people reverberates from decade to decade.

This doesn't mean that their derision methods were not effective. If you want to deride such racists back, use their methods. Add an echo to _their_ names. It's an effective sound effect; don't let it be relegated to the realm of hate speech tactics; take it back from them; use it for comedy, not hate speech.
