# 1. No One’s Crazy

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered three questions about luck and differences in people's worldviews.

## Why do people disagree on obvious things? 

Different worldviews.

> We all think we know how the world works. But we’ve all only experienced a tiny sliver of it.

People disagree even on things as basic as the value of saving money. Some may agree that setting up an automated transfer of money into the savings account may be a good idea, others may only be compelled to save money if they have a reason or a savings goal (e.g., a new car), and still others may be against savings because for them, making money means spending money. Whatever their reasons, they're extrapolations of a tiny sliver of knowledge they've learned as part of their lived experience.

> We’ve had different lives shaped by different and equally persuasive experiences. Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

## Are successful investors simply the products of their time? 

Yes, people find success if they happen to be at the right place, at the right time. For example, highly successful bond manager Bill Gross conceded that his success was only made possible by him being born in the right decade.

> He would probably not be where he is today if he had been born a decade earlier or later.

Gross's early adult life showed him that a lucrative investment strategy must involve bonds. This assumption continued to hold true through his career.

> Gross’s career coincided almost perfectly with a generational collapse in interest rates that gave bond prices a tailwind. That kind of thing doesn’t just affect the opportunities you come across; it affects what you think about those opportunities when they’re presented to you. To Gross, bonds were wealth-generating machines. To his father’s generation, who grew up with and endured higher inflation, they might be seen as wealth incinerators.

Those of us who live through sharply changing market conditions don't get to be so lucky. We make key decisions that make or break our fortunes based on the market conditions with which we grew up, so if those change, we have nothing else to guide us.

> People’s lifetime investment decisions are heavily anchored to the experiences those investors had in their own generation—especially experiences early in their adult life. If you grew up when inflation was high, you invested less of your money in bonds later in life compared to those who grew up when inflation was low. If you happened to grow up when the stock market was strong, you invested more of your money in stocks later in life compared to those who grew up when stocks were weak.

If your life fits between major events that restructure the economy, then you're destined for prosperity. Otherwise, you must make your own luck.

> Individual investors’ willingness to bear risk depends on personal history. Not intelligence, or education, or sophistication. Just the dumb luck of when and where you were born.

## Why do people in poverty waste their money on lottery tickets? 

Because lottery tickets are affordable for them, and they view it as their only ticket out of poverty. By spending money on a lottery ticket, they keep the dream of making it out of poverty alive.

> We live paycheck-to-paycheck and saving seems out of reach. Our prospects for much higher wages seem out of reach. We can’t afford nice vacations, new cars, health insurance, or homes in safe neighborhoods. We can’t put our kids through college without crippling debt. Much of the stuff you people who read finance books either have now, or have a good chance of getting, we don’t. Buying a lottery ticket is the only time in our lives we can hold a tangible dream of getting the good stuff that you already have and take for granted. We are paying for a dream, and you may not understand that because you are already living a dream. That’s why we buy more tickets than you do.
