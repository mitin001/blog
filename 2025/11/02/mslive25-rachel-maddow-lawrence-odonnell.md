This live event shared by [Rachel Maddow](../../../2025/11/01/rachel-maddow.md) defined activism.

## What does it mean to be an activist? 

It means showing people the humanity of those for whom you're standing up.

> When people are being discriminatory or cruel, I believe that that means that they are not seeing the target of their discrimination or cruelty as a full human being.

To counter the discriminatory or cruel views of others, speak your truth. Convince those people that you or the people you're trying to protect are just as deserving of their humanity as they are.

> You have to speak from the heart.

Oftentimes, activists are the people who themselves belong to the group being othered by hate groups or the authoritarian regimes. To counter the propaganda, such activists must simply put themselves on display as what they truly are: human beings.

> You are advocating for the humanity of yourself or your fellow Americans.

Rachel Maddow insists that if you hear anyone being put down as a less-than, that should be your cue to stand up for them. Once an activist, always an activist.

> There's no perfect argument, but recognizing the full humanity of anybody, everybody that is in your sphere, not letting anybody talk about anybody like they're an animal or like they're less than human or less than you is the most important lesson I ever learned in activism.
