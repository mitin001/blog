# 4. Why Everybody Sounds the Same Online

This chapter of [Algospeak](../../../2025/11/20/algospeak.md) answered four questions about how we speak and two questions about why the digital age is not what it first seemed.

## Why do people uptalk?

Because it's a way to make you engage with them. Their speech doesn't sound like monologue. It makes you feel like you are collaborating with the speaker. Because every sentence sounds unfinished, it makes you lean in and listen closer.

> You as the viewer feel as if something is coming next, so you keep watching to get the dopamine hit of hearing what it is. At the same time, the rising tone makes it sound almost as though the creator is constantly asking you for your opinion, which keeps you interested and engaged. Uptalk has long been regarded as a sign of uncertainty, and by using it, the influencer gives the illusion of seeking validation from you. This almost conversational aspect to the influencer accent erodes the boundary between one-sided and two-sided communication, making it easier for you to feel engaged with the creator.

The rise of TikTok has made the uptalk even more popular. This accent found the space where its engaging properties pay off. The TikTok audience also seems to prefer elongated sounds to silence. They don't want to watch you think of the next thing to say in silence; they want to hear sounds from your mouth as you're thinking. The new iteration of the uptalk is the influencer accent, and the elongated words no longer appear at the end of every sentence but throughout it.

> Emphatic prosody is incredible for floor holding. Our brains like to be completely absorbed in an experience, and the lullaby-esque, lilting tones of the influencer accent scratch that itch while simultaneously enveloping us in a loop of engagement tactics. Now that every other word is emphasized, we’re drawn in multiple times in each sentence. If your attention starts drifting, the added stress pulls you right back, making it harder to break away and easier to personally resonate with a video. Meanwhile, the vowel lengthening and overemphasis of the r sound are also textbook retention strategies because they keep us hanging on the elongated word. If you look at a children’s show like Sesame Street, you’ll see the exact same thing happening. The characters will frequently lengthen their vowels, not only to make it easier for kids to understand them, but also to continuously recapture their young audience’s attention. Hi, kiiids! Today we’re learning the alphabeeet! In this era of information overload, influencers are turning to the same floor-holding strategies we use to entertain toddlers. The lengthened words further serve to cover up any pauses that might follow an influencer’s sentence. Obviously, pauses are bad for the algorithm; few things are less interesting to viewers than dead air. Silence breaks the illusion that you’re experiencing a fun little world and reminds you that you’re just a person staring at a screen. Influencers, especially those working in an extemporaneous or improvisational capacity, therefore need to find a way to avoid silence. That’s where the rising tones and longer word sounds come in.

Elongating words is one way the uptalker holds the floor. If you want to hold the floor without resorting to the uptalk, be funny.

> A stand-up comedian needs more than jokes to entertain an audience. They need rhythm, timing, and nonverbal cues to “hold the floor” of the interaction, keeping your attention so they can deliver their jokes.

However, the influencer age, with its detailed video analytics data gathered on billions of attention-deficient users scrolling away at any moment they're not entertained, is showing us that, when it comes to holding the floor, the uptalk is far more effective than what comedians do.

> It works best when you never sound like you’re finishing a sentence.

## Where did the uptalk come from?

The natural re-emergence of the uptalk among TikTok influencers shows that this accent is simply the natural way of talking to the camera. This is how humans talk when their communication has to be one-sided.

> Monologues are fundamentally different from conversational speech. They’re given with the intention of delivering an uninterrupted message. That’s why the uptalk in the influencer accent can be oddly reminiscent of a voicemail on an answering machine, and why the stress patterns are kind of similar to those of the broadcaster voice. We talk a certain way when we want to keep attention but we’re not expecting a response.

Notable pre-TikTok uptalkers (celebrities like Kim Kardashian) must've engaged in extensive one-sided communication during their formative years, because where else could've made them this way?

## What is the difference between an accent and an affectation?

If you're not as fluent in an accent as most of its speakers, then you're speaking with an affectation, not an accent. Affectations are contrived.

> Forced accents, like when Americans pretend to speak British.

Sometimes people learn affectations to align themselves with privileged groups. Learning an affectation can also be a job requirement, e.g., to be a news anchor, one must learn to speak with a broadcaster voice.

> There was also the transatlantic accent, that half-American, half-British dialect you probably associate with fast-talking actors in old-timey black-and-white movies. Until the mid-twentieth century, everybody working in the entertainment industry was expected to be versed in the accent, which served to audibly separate the wealthy upper class from the less educated lower classes. Both the transatlantic accent and the broadcaster voice are affectations, intentionally taught to create prestigious in-groups and consciously acquired by their speakers. They are highly regarded precisely because of their exclusivity.

## What is the millennial pause?

The pause between when the person hits _record_ and starts talking. It's called the _millennial_ pause because younger generations start talking right away or edit the pause out, or so the stereotype leads us to believe.

> We do immediately start talking because we’ve been conditioned to constantly stimulate our viewers. Any little break in their entertainment hurts our chances of virality.

To start a video with dead air is to almost guarantee that the viewer will scroll away.

## Is YouTube a place where anything goes and only truly the best content makes it to the top?

No, there's a science to making a video that will do well on YouTube, and it all has to do with capturing and retaining the viewer's attention. A video that can do that will rise to the top, far surpassing much of the more informative content that took far more effort to make. All you need is an unending steam of hooks.

> In September 2024, an employee of MrBeast—the world’s most successful YouTuber—leaked a thirty-six-page onboarding memo revealing the strategies he uses to consistently go viral. The memo shows that his success is anything but coincidence: Throughout the document, he meticulously breaks down his creative decisions into extremely analytical explanations of how everything is engineered to improve his retention rate. This invaluable insight into MrBeast’s headspace proves that creators at the top level must be deliberate in order to keep succeeding. It’s not about quality so much as it is about attention.

## If the Internet age brought everyone into the same space, why are we so divided? 

Because the Internet also made it easier to people to form increasingly niche subcultures, and division seems to have ultimately won the united-divided tug of war.

> The algorithm simultaneously unites us and divides us by creating a common online culture and then dividing us into smaller and smaller groups for us to create our own subcultures.

Very few people believe in ridiculous conspiracy theories (like that the Earth is flat), but when even a hundred of such people are connected by the algorithm, then they form a community that reaches the critical mass: it starts drawing in people on the fringes (those who could be convinced that the Earth is flat but would know better had they not been sucked into such a community). Eventually, the world splits into those who need an authoritarian to tell them what to think and those who resist them.
