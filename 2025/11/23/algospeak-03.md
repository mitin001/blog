# 3. No Because What Happened to Your Attention?

This chapter of [Algospeak](../../../2025/11/20/algospeak.md) answered seven questions about writing for engagement from the perspective of a TikTok content creator.

## How to write a perfect title? 

When people struggling to find uses for ChatGPT say it could write headlines, can the random generator of generic words really do that well? A title must be unique and attention-grabbing. People don't want to read anything generic, not even something as short as a title.

> People don’t want to look at a picture just titled “snow,” because that just sounds generic.

A better title makes the person reading it want to know more.

> Snowfall in Sequoia National Park, California.

This title provides just enough detail to inspire curiosity.

> Just enough to succinctly capture the viewer’s curiosity and lure them in. That kind of title might not seem remarkable to you, but the wording works wonders because it falls into a marketing Goldilocks zone called the curiosity gap. You know what snow looks like, but you don’t know what snow in Sequoia National Park looks like, so you become slightly more curious. You’ve suddenly discovered a gap in your knowledge that you need to fill.

## How to write a perfect opening line?

The author shares the opening lines from those of his videos that have gone viral.

> My favorite thing about X is… This is my least favorite thing about X. I am constantly amazed by X. The most interesting X is… The best part of X is… It should be illegal to X. I hate it more than anything when X…

Collectively, TikTok content creators arrived at the set of the most optimal opening lines, where the user's constant urge to scroll away at the flick of a finger acted as the selection pressure. These are the phrases that the majority of video viewers couldn't resist.

> As the viewer, you’re now intrigued: How will I as the influencer defend my outlandish statement? The only way to find out is to keep watching, which is exactly what I want you to do.

Another way to get someone's attention is to play into group dynamics.

> I can’t be the only one who’s noticed X. Am I the only one who didn’t know X?

Like cures like. If you want someone's attention, exploit their desire to get the attention of others. Promise them the information they could use to that end or give them validation.

> If you did notice or know the thing I’m talking about, you feel good about yourself because you’re part of an in-group; you feel included. If you didn’t, then you start to feel left out of a social experience. Lucky for you, the way to become part of the in-group is to watch my video.

## Why is it so fashionable to use the word _people_ in an attention-getter?

Because the term _people_ applies to everyone (it has mass appeal), and it also plays on everyone's need to belong with others (_people_, plural).

> If you’re part of “people,” you’re going to feel connected to my topic. If you’re not part of “people,” you now want to catch up, or else you run the risk of being behind on a cultural reference or piece of information.

These are the attention-getters that have been selected by TikTok users. People don't scroll away from them.

> People are finally doing X. One thing people don’t tell you about X is Y. Why aren’t people talking about X? I don’t think people understand/realize X.

We can't afford to write boring opening lines in this attention economy.

> We talk about attention as something that is “captured” and “held” before eventually being “lost.” To be captivating, something must hold you captive, the implication being that your attention was seized and could escape at any moment. There’s a sense of scarcity, of ephemerality, and in the internet age there’s a real pressure on those who want to hold your easily fractured attention.

## Why isn't anything stopping BuzzFeed from publishing articles that routinely break the promises in their headlines?

> Like those BuzzFeed articles claiming that the ninth fact on their list will surprise you. These content styles exploit our curiosity gap between knowing that facts exist and not knowing why some facts are better than others, yet they regularly withhold that satisfaction, which helpfully spurs comments of frustration.

Enragement is engagement. Why satisfy your readers when their dissatisfaction makes you chart higher in the eyes of the algorithm? The author confesses to exploiting the power of ragebaiting in his own videos.

> When I did make a video on the etymology of “skibidi,” I ragebaited my audience to a certain extent. I knew some people would be upset about the latest generational slang, which would make them hate-watch and comment.

## Why are people so drawn to trashy reality shows?

For the same reason silly TikToks are popular. They validate the viewer's superiority complex.

> It feels good to criticize something when it makes us feel better about ourselves. Whether it’s an obnoxious Netflix show or a stupid TikTok, it can be a guilty pleasure to feel a little self-righteous. Ironically, we’re feeding into the system we love to hate: Whenever ragebait content successfully goads us into engaging with it, the algorithm pushes more ragebait content as a good way to keep people on the app.

The more some of us need to feel superior, the higher the percentage of content available to rest of us to consume is stupid content. It's a vicious cycle.

> Algorithms are the culprits, influencers are the accomplices, language is the weapon, and you, dear reader, are the victim.

## What can you get from books that you can't get from TikTok videos? 

A longer, more detailed, and more nuanced exploration of a given subject. The transcript of a TikTok video is optimized to capture and then consistently recapture one's attention. Such hooks take away from nuance. A book speaks to a more focused audience.

> Now that you’re reading, I have access to a different, longer kind of attention where I can lend nuance to my opinions without the fear that you’ll immediately put this down for another book the moment I write a lackluster sentence. Things are different online, where I feel like I’m fighting a constant war for your attention. I carefully script out all my videos to maximize the addictiveness of each sentence. Beyond the initial hook, I sneak in little “microhooks” to everything I say, making sure I recapture your attention if it does happen to drift.

Every line of the video transcript must be fit for being quoted in a comment under it.

> Wordplay captures viewers’ attention and consistently generates comments from people quoting their favorite part of the video.

If every line in your transcript has a string match in the comments, then you did your job as a content creator.

## Why do content creators on TikTok sometimes start their videos with _no because_?

For the same reason they start their videos with _wait_ or _hold on_. It's a discourse marker commanding the audiences to stop speaking (or thinking) and start listening.

> The discourse markers are used as little linguistic signals that the speaker is taking control of the discussion. They’re subtle ways to communicate “look at me, it’s my turn to speak,” and that’s exactly what’s happening with “no because.” It’s a tactic used to gain attention.

A discourse marker primes the listener to expect engaging content. When the audience expects the content to be engaging, they're likelier to judge it so and not scroll away.

> When a person is exposed to a certain stimulus, they become more mentally prepared for a related stimulus. Over time, people have become “primed” to associate the “no because” discourse marker with engaging content. This effect is amplified by two factors: First, the people media-savvy enough to intentionally start their videos with a discourse marker are likely also good at making engaging videos, which suggests a real correlation with quality. Second, the more someone is taught to link two stimuli, the stronger the priming effect becomes, until “no because” eventually became a self-fulfilling prophecy.
