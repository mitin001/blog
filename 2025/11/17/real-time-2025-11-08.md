This episode of [Real Time](../../../2025/10/16/real-time.md) answered two questions about Democrats and Republicans.

## What to say when people ask you about whether you're a Democrat or a Republican? 

Say what Kenny Chesney's father said. 

> I'm a Democrat, but I'm saving up to be a Republican.

## Will American leaders continue to alternate between Democrats and Republicans? 

Yes, even now, in the age of extremes, we keep alternating between the parties we put in power. Elections are a cycle. We elect a party, it disappoints us, we elect another party, it also disappoints up, we go back to electing the first party again, and the cycle repeats. Nowadays the reason for disappointment is that each party goes too far with their bullshit.

> We just keep asking for normal, and nobody ever gives it to us.

The Republicans are trolling us with their authoritarian aspirations, and the Democrats make us cringe over their stupid policies that don't help anyone but allow them to virtue-signal to each other.
