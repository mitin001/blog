# 17. The Seduction of Pessimism

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered three questions about optimism and pessimism and one question about financial literacy. 

## How is optimism synonymous with the belief that most people are good?

Had everyone tried to make the world a better place, optimism would have been reality.

> Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way. The simple idea that most people wake up in the morning trying to make things a little better and more productive than wake up looking to cause trouble is the foundation of optimism.

Optimism is not the same as complacency.

> Pessimism isn’t just more common than optimism. It also sounds smarter. It’s intellectually captivating, and it’s paid more attention than optimism, which is often viewed as being oblivious to risk.

The world generally trends in the optimistic direction, but it is punctuated by setbacks, which are easier to notice. Hence the proliferation of pessimists.

> Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant. It’s easier to create a narrative around pessimism because the story pieces tend to be fresher and more recent. Optimistic narratives require looking at a long stretch of history and developments, which people tend to forget and take more effort to piece together.

John Stuart Mill noticed that pessimism is equated by many with wisdom.

> Not the man who hopes when others despair, but the man who despairs when others hope, is admired by a large class of persons as a sage.

We are wired for pessimism. The gain-loss continuum is asymmetrical in terms of our emotions, and the assymetry is in the negative direction. We delight in gains far less than we despair over losses. Our aversion to loss is greater than the pleasure we derive from our gains. Daniel Kahneman explains that loss aversion is a consequence of natural selection.

> Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.

A pessimist lives a life of despair punctuated by moments of unexpected joy.

> Expecting things to be great means a best-case scenario that feels flat. Pessimism reduces expectations, narrowing the gap between possible outcomes and outcomes you feel great about. Maybe that’s why it’s so seductive. Expecting things to be bad is the best way to be pleasantly surprised when they’re not. Which, ironically, is something to be optimistic about.

It is better and more true to life to instead live optimistically: expect life to bring you joy and know that moments of despair are fleeting. An unlikely optimist Stephen Hawking lived a happy life because he lived it free of expectation.

> My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus.

## Should you take pessimistic/apocalyptic predictions that we're running out of a given resource at face value?

No, alarmists usually assume that humans won't react to the problem in a corrective way, but we always do. For example, the pessimistic predictions that we would run out of oil never materialized, and now they are irrelevant.

> To a pessimist extrapolating oil trends in 2008, of course things looked bad. To a realist who understood that necessity is the mother of all invention, it was far less scary. Assuming that something ugly will stay ugly is an easy forecast to make. And it’s persuasive, because it doesn’t require imagining the world changing. But problems correct and people adapt. Threats incentivize solutions in equal magnitude.

We won't run out of water. We will engineer our way out of climate change. We won't let the expansion of the sun destroy our only home in the universe (if humanity even survives for that long). For all that's wrong with human nature, it gives us our ingenuity, which ends up saving us every time.

## Why did people not believe that flying machines were possible even as they saw them in action?

Because people thought the demonstrations were fake. No one questioned the conventional wisdom that heavy machines could not stay in air for long without falling. The Detroit Free Press articulated this view in their issue from January 5th, 1889.

> The smallest possible weight of a flying machine, with the necessary fuel and engineer, could not be less than 300 or 400 pounds … but there is a low limit of weight, certainly not much beyond fifty pounds, beyond which it is impossible for an animal to fly. Nature has reached this limit, and with her utmost effort has failed to pass it.

Frederick Lewis Allen likened the assumption of trickery that surrounded demonstrations of flying machines in the early 1900s to what we regard as hoaxes today: demonstrations of supernatural phenomena.

> People were so convinced that flying was impossible that most of those who saw them flying about Dayton [Ohio] in 1905 decided that what they had seen must be some trick without significance—somewhat as most people today would regard a demonstration of, say, telepathy. It was not until May, 1908—nearly four and a half years after the Wright’s first flight—that experienced reporters were sent to observe what they were doing, experienced editors gave full credence to these reporters’ excited dispatches, and the world at last woke up to the fact that human flight had been successfully accomplished.

Some doubters took years to overcome their skepticism. The Washington Post was among them.

> There will never be such a thing as commercial aerial freighters. Freight will continue to drag its slow weight across the patient earth.

The 1909 issue of the Washington Post that contained the skeptical pronouncement did not age well.

> The first cargo plane took off five months later.

## Why should everyone learn financial literacy?

For the same reason everyone should be health-literate. It affects everyone.

> There are two topics that will affect your life whether you are interested in them or not: money and health.

Your health and financial decisions even affect other people. We all breathe the same air; it's not to be polluted with toxins or pathogens. We all share the same economy; it's not to be polluted with toxic ideas or exploited for parasitic gain.

> In investing you must identify the price of success—volatility and loss amid the long backdrop of growth—and be willing to pay it.

Financial literacy boils down to a handful of simple ideas: save money, do not despair when the markets are down (they are most of the time, and yet there are almost always year-over-year gains), and let the money accumulate and compound.
