This episode of [Pivot](../../../2025/10/14/pivot.md) answered a question about end-stage capitalism.

## What happens when we allow large corporations to set political and social priorities for the world?

We all become addicts. They get us addicted to their products. We're running this experiment now. We're allowing large corporations to do what they will to us to extract the maximum profit. Once a cluster of companies gets large enough, it becomes a sinkhole, and much of the rest of the economy falls into it.

> Our economy is a giant bet on AI right now.

The problem with this arrangement is these companies dictate the political and social priorities of the population.

> These companies have an economic interest, invested interest in evolving a new asocial, asexual species of young male.

In their bloodless pursuit of quarter-over-quarter gains in earnings, they've figured out a way to extract maximum profits from the population. It is to addict all of us to the screen, starting with those with the least amount of willpower.

> Men aged 20 to 30 now in America are spending less time outdoors than prison inmates.
