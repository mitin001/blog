# 16. You & Me

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered three questions about investments. 

## What causes an economic bubble?

When people jump on a bandwagon hoping to make some quick cash.

> Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short term. That process feeds on itself. As traders push up short-term returns, they attract even more traders. Before long—and it often doesn’t take long—the dominant market price-setters with the most authority are those with shorter time horizons. Bubbles aren’t so much about valuations rising. That’s just a symptom of something else: time horizons shrinking as more short-term traders enter the playing field.

If you're a long-term investor, stay away from bubbles. Don't invest in cryptocurrencies or AI. They're going the way of the dotcom. By investing in bubbles, you're joining the pool of unserious investors hoping to pump and dump. Their gains are at the expense of those who cash out too late.

> Bubbles do their damage when long-term investors playing one game start taking their cues from those short-term traders playing another. Cisco stock rose 300% in 1999 to $60 per share. At that price the company was valued at $600 billion, which is insane. Few actually thought it was worth that much; the day-traders were just having their fun. Economist Burton Malkiel once pointed out that Cisco’s implied growth rate at that valuation meant it would become larger than the entire U.S. economy within 20 years. But if you were a long-term investor in 1999, $60 was the only price available to buy. And many people were buying it at that price. So you may have looked around and said to yourself, “Wow, maybe these other investors know something I don’t.” Maybe you went along with it. You even felt smart about it. What you don’t realize is that the traders who were setting the marginal price of the stock were playing a different game than you were. Sixty dollars a share was a reasonable price for the traders, because they planned on selling the stock before the end of the day, when its price would probably be higher. But sixty dollars was a disaster in the making for you, because you planned on holding shares for the long run. These two investors rarely even know that each other exist. But they’re on the same field, running toward each other. When their paths blindly collide, someone gets hurt. Many finance and investment decisions are rooted in watching what other people do and either copying them or betting against them. But when you don’t know why someone behaves like they do you won’t know how long they’ll continue acting that way, what will make them change their mind, or whether they’ll ever learn their lesson.

## When someone tells broad swaths of the public to buy a given stock, should you follow their advice? 

No. No one stock is for the public at large. Different people have different investment goals, and they should select stocks based on those. No one stock will be flexible enough to serve the broad range of financial goals found in the public at large.

> When a commentator on CNBC says, “You should buy this stock,” keep in mind that they do not know who you are. Are you a teenager trading for fun? An elderly widow on a limited budget? A hedge fund manager trying to shore up your books before the quarter ends? Are we supposed to think those three people have the same priorities, and that whatever level a particular stock is trading at is right for all three of them?

## Why should you not make purchases based on what others are buying? 

Because people buy things to further their goals, and you don't necessarily have the same goals as the people you're looking to for purchasing decisions.

> Much consumer spending, particularly in developed countries, is socially driven: subtly influenced by people you admire, and done because you subtly want people to admire you. But while we can see how much money other people spend on cars, homes, clothes, and vacations, we don’t get to see their goals, worries, and aspirations. A young lawyer aiming to be a partner at a prestigious law firm might need to maintain an appearance that I, a writer who can work in sweatpants, have no need for. But when his purchases set my own expectations, I’m wandering down a path of potential disappointment because I’m spending the money without the career boost he’s getting. We might not even have different styles. We’re just playing a different game.

Instead of looking at others for what to spend your money on, look within yourself. What are your goals, and what is the least expensive thing that can help you reach them? This works for tangible things, but it can also work for investments. Poor investments happen when people blindly follow others in selecting where to invest their money instead of assessing their own goals.

> Investors often innocently take cues from other investors who are playing a different game than they are.
