# [Empty and Misleading Communication Takes Over Organizations](https://doi.org/10.1177/2631787720929704)

This scholarly paper was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on bullshit asymmetry](../../../2025/10/30/wikipedia_brandolinis_law.md). It answered seven questions about bullshit.

## Why has bullshit overtaken the professional world?

Permissive uncertainty.

> This is a situation where actors do not know what will happen and are willing to consider almost any knowledge that might plug this epistemic gap.

Stakeholders in the professional world ask many questions they don't understand, but they want the person on their payroll to know the answer anyway (or pretend to know it). The uncertainty is permissive in that the stakeholders often settle for a bullshit answer. This is similar to how students earn passing grades at school. Just as students of the past came away from school having learned the kind of discipline required of factory workers, most students of today come away from school having learned to bullshit.

> Students would rely on a few signals of knowledge (such as a few key names or facts). The students would hide their intentions of avoiding scrutiny by feigned fascination with the topic. But most importantly, they would present themselves in an excessively confident manner. They hoped this mixture of conspicuous signals, feigned interest and extreme confidence meant they were able to get through lessons with minimal work. And typically it worked. After leaving, many of the students realized that this ability was the main thing they had learned during their time at the school. It was a skill which stood them in good stead when they took up leadership positions throughout American society.

Bullshit by its nature is highly visible. LinkedIn is a social network for professional bullshitters. Serious professionals don't have a social network.

> Bullshitting is a social practice that organizational members engage with to become part of a speech community, to get things done in that community, and to reinforce their identity. When the practice of bullshitting works, it can gradually expand from a small group to take over an entire organization and industry.

Bullshitting arises in situations where incompetence goes unchecked.

> Bullshitting is triggered by a speech community with many conceptual entrepreneurs, significant amounts of noisy ignorance and permissive uncertainty.

Bullshitting is reinforced passively.

> People articulating empty and misleading statements that are processed in a shallow way and lead to surface-level agreement. When this game works, it can enhance the image and identity of players. If this happens, they are likely to engage in further rounds of bullshitting and reinvest in the speech community which perpetuates bullshitting. When the game backfires, it can undermine the players’ identity and image. This makes them less likely to want to play the bullshit game again and reinvest in the speech community which encourages bullshitting. When bullshitting reinforces players’ image and identity, it increases the scale and scope of bullshitting. As a consequence, bullshitting can evolve from being informal interaction into a routine practice, a formalized procedure and even a sacred ritual.

The fact that workplaces have become overrun with bullshit is a signifier that they've become overrun with incompetence. Everywhere you turn there is an imposter attempting to bullshit his way through the day's work.

> To bluff one’s way through something by talking nonsense.

Bullshitters make up for their lacking skills by creating the impression of the opposite. The self-concept of a bullshitter is overwhelmingly and undeservedly positive. He will brag about non-existent achievements. His toll in life is to surround himself with mirrors and blow smoke.

> Bullshitters were also likely to engage in significantly more self-enhancement behaviours.

It is human nature to try to find meaning in the meaningless, and bullshitters take full advantage of that. 

> People with uncritically open minds were more likely to assess tweets by the New Age guru Deepak Chopra as being profound statements of truth. Interestingly, they were also likely to say that randomly generated sentences were also profound statements of truth.

People can talk for hours with the latest generation of random word generators, AI chatbots. The amount of bullshit spewed our way is overwhelming to the human brain that is already far too reliant on heuristics to make sense of the world.

> We gain most of our knowledge second hand. This means that we do not do epistemic due diligence ourselves. We are usually not cognitively equipped to do such due diligence, and even when we are, it is exhausting for us and alienating for others.

We have allowed bullshit to overtake the professional world because we prioritize the social aspect of interacting with other people over the quality of the information they give us. Any exchange of information that might take place during a conversation is secondary. A conversation is, first and foremost, an exchange of attention.

> Our reliance upon social cues means we systematically relax our epistemic norms to deal with the social pragmatic need to get along.

We have created a perfect environment for the proliferation of bullshit by giving people with no expertise too much power and too many responsibilities. We have created a society that forces people to bullshit.

> Middle managers are often relatively ignorant about the work their subordinates are engaged with, but are under pressure to act as the leader by doing or say something.

What incentive is there for a middle manager to train in the domain of its subordinates when simply pretending and speaking in empty generalities already earns them a pass? As more and more middle managers get away with bullshit, it eventually replaces the truth. Corporate bullshit is well on its way to becoming a new religion.

> Bullshit shifts from being an improvised local language game through a process of routinization and formalization and eventually becomes seen as sacred.

## Why do bullshitters sometimes put their bullshit into flow charts?

To make their bullshit seem to have meaning. And, by the way, it's not just flow charts.

> Assessment systems, rankings, metrics, flow charts and tick-boxes.

These are common bullshit delivery devices.

> When previous empty and misleading claims start to be embodied into these devices, they develop their own substantive reference point. They start to take on their own seemingly objective reference points. This makes what might have previously seemed to be a vacuous statement appear to have a greater degree of substance.

Do not let the format of the bullshit distract you. Learn to see through the flow charts. Had the bullshit not been put in a flow chart, you would dismiss it immediately. So, don't be tempted to give a flow chart a second shot either. A change in its format doesn't make the bullshit any more objective.

## How to call someone out on their bullshit?

Ask them to clarify their statement. Bullshit is a deliberate obfuscation of emptiness. To clarify it is to reveal that no point was actually being made.

> Bullshit entails claims which are disconnected from normal standards of truth such as logic, clarity and evidence.

Ask them to provide evidence to their claim. Ask them to clarify their logic for arriving from said evidence to their bullshit. Again, expect to discover a void of an argument. A common strategy bullshitters use when called out is dodging the question, which can itself be called out.

> They answer a fairly direct question with an irrelevant answer.

A word of caution: people don't generally call others out on their bullshit because it can create a hostile work environment, and it is also exhausting.

> If they were to engage in greater epistemological due diligence, then social interaction would become too costly, time-consuming and conflict inducing.

Calling out people's bullshit will harm your relationships with them. Bullshit is also asymmetrical, and not in favor of the truth seeker.

> The effort they need to put in to refute bullshit is often of an order of magnitude greater than what is required to produce the bullshit in the first place.

## What is the etymology of the term bullshit?

It's French, and not in the "pardon my French" way.

> The word is rooted in ‘bull’ which has been used from the 17th century onwards to mean nonsense. This in turns derives from the Old French term _bole_ which means fraud and deceit.

British soldiers cared too much about their appearance and similar sorts of ridiculous rituals, similar to how professionals today care about theirs.

> During World War I, British commanding officers emphasized ‘bull’. This meant paying significant attention to soldiers’ appearances by ensuring they were perfectly dressed and their shoes were shined, even when this focus on appearance hindered the daily tasks of waging war.

Sharp-tongued Australasian soldiers appended _shit_ to the name of the ridiculous practice of their British counterparts, and, predictably, the word took off.

> Australian and New Zealand troops mocked British officers by calling it ‘bullshit’.

Leave it to the military to coin a term this crass but also this fitting.

> We’ve got to get this place bullshitted up—the Commanding Officer is coming around tomorrow morning.

## What's the difference between the bullshitter and a liar?

A liar knows the truth, but a bullshitter does not.

> A liar is concerned about the truth, but attempts to replace it with falsehood. In contrast, the bullshitter is unconcerned with the truth and speaks with no reference to it.

## What were the trendy jump-on-the-bandwagon-and-cash-out technologies before AI?

Blockchain, dotcom, and tronics.

> Organizations often use trendy but misleading names to attract resources (particularly from the uninformed). In recent years, firms have gained a boost in valuation by adopting a name invoking blockchain technology.

Just as seeing the word _blockchain_ used outside of the cryptocurrency context makes us cringe today, people appending .com to sell their shit made us cringe in the early 2000s. Do you remember Fear.com, the movie? 

> In the late 1990s, firms gained a similar boost in value by adding ‘.com’ to their name.

Behold the animatronics, mechatronics, immunotronics, etc.

> In the early 1960s, firms with the suffix ‘tronics’ were perceived as being more valuable.

## What causes an erosion of trust in trustworthy institutions?

Bullshitter-politicians. These people know that serious people won't trust them, so they do all they can to break the trust many have placed in serious institutions.

> One standard move of populist politicians has been to project the lack of trust others have for them outwards onto other people or institutions.
