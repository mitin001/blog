This episode of [Real Time](../../../2025/10/16/real-time.md) answered a question about health insurance.

## When you're paying for health insurance but are not using it, is it a waste of money?

No, you're paying for the healthcare of other people who need health insurance, so that when it's your time to need health insurance, it will be paid for by the people who are paying for health insurance but aren't using it.

> No plan works in health care unless you make the young buy it when they don't need it, so that later on in life, looking ahead, kids, then it will be there for you. This is how a society works.
