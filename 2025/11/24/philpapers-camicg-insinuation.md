# [Insinuation, Common Ground, and the Conversational Record](https://philpapers.org/archive/CAMICG.pdf)

This scholarly paper was referenced by [a scholarly article on trans philosophy](../../../2025/10/30/doi-10.1002-9781119635253.ch19-trans-philosophy.md). It answered two questions about insinuated speech.

## How to counter insinuation? 

When you hear an insinuation, simply stop engaging with the speaker and walk away. This person argues in bad faith.

> You know that Obama’s middle name is Hussein. I’m just saying.

Any serious person will resent the insinuation.

> Are you suggesting that Barack Obama is a radical Islamist?

But don't say that. You can't voice your resentment or try to call someone out on it because they will either make use of the plausible deniability afforded to them by not saying the quiet part out loud, or they will twist your words against you.

> You said it, not me; but now that you mention it…

Here speaker S baited hearer H to entertain some of the bigoted beliefs the speaker is trying to communicate with impunity.

> S would be delighted for H to follow up by enumerating some of the many sinister features purportedly possessed by people named ‘Hussein’ , and by Barack Obama in particular. Such insinuations function as probes of perspectival alignment; as interpretive harmony becomes more firmly established, S may feel increasingly free to overtly assert claims that would be controversial or repugnant in other contexts.

Continuing to engage with an insinuator will only make you more frustrated.

> Insinuations do place resistant hearers in a rhetorically frustrating position.

If abandoning the conversation is not an option and you're forced to continue it, counter the insinuation with pedantry.

> It is, I take it, an empirical fact that insinuated speech is often deniable, and that hearers sometimes retaliate with pedantry.

Ask questions as if you don't understand what the speaker is trying to insinuate. For example, "why should we care what Obama's middle name is? We want to know how he is as a leader." Pedantry of this kind works wherever there is insinuation, and politics is by far not the only subject ripe for insinuation.

> When a professor writes "Mr. X’s command of English is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular" as the entirety of a letter of recommendation, their reticence effectively communicates that Mr. X is a poor candidate, even though the letter’s explicit content is innocuous.

One can counter the insinuation to discredit a job applicant with exactly the same kind of pedantry one can use to counter the insinuation to discredit a presidential candidate: with _flat-footed pedantry_.

> Why should we care about Mr. X’s elocutionary abilities? We want to know how he is as a philosopher.

Another way to counter insinuation is with _cunning pedantry_: to draw an unintended conclusion from the speaker's statement.

> Well, people always say that anyone who can speak clearly can think clearly, so I guess you’re saying that we should hire him.

At this point, you will be playing the game of chicken for who takes the bait first. The insinuator has the upper hand because he started it, but you are fueled by your indignance over it.

> With both speaker and hearer dragging their interpretive feet, conversation slows to an unproductive literalistic crawl.

## If a person doesn't directly ask another to commit a crime but insinuates it, how does that get treated in court? 

Just as if the request to commit a crime was direct, as long as the plaintiff can show that he's refused to go along with it and that any reasonable person would construe the insinuation to be made with criminal intent.

> Legal and administrative standards recognize that even indirect, insinuated contents can be genuinely meant, and that speakers can sometimes be held liable even for statements designed to be deniable—so long as the plaintiff can demonstrate that the relevant suggestions and refusals were in fact made.

The same applies to a request for a quid pro quo sexual favor. If the defendant insinuates it but the plaintiff refuses it directly, the defendant can be held criminally liable for the transgressive statement, even if indirect.
