# Why Your Kids Are Saying “Unalive”

This chapter of [Algospeak](../../../2025/11/20/algospeak.md) answered a question about the evolution of language in the cyberspace.

## Does the emergence of words like _unalive_ show that our language is nearing its demise? 

No, just the opposite. It shows that our language is alive and well. When a language undergoes changes, they are signs of its vitality. A classic way by which a language changes is the continued euphemistic treatment of taboo subjects like death. Before _unalive_, there was _decease_. Before _decease_, there was _die_. Before _die_, there was _passed away_, and so on.

> This is nothing new. We have been euphemizing death as long as we’ve had language. The verb “to decease,” for example, comes from decessus, the Latin word for “departure,” which was introduced as a more agreeable alternative to the existing word for death, mors. Similarly, the verb “to die” was originally an Old Norse euphemism for the Old English verb sweltan, which was, in turn, likely also a euphemism for the even older English word diegan (related to “die” but then forgotten long enough to be reintroduced in a new form). Clearly, even the stoic Romans and fearless Vikings got as queasy about death as modern middle-schoolers. It’s only because we’ve been constantly running linguistic circles around our mortality that we still use phrases like “passed away,” “left this world,” and “departed.” In that regard, “unalive” is just another step in this ever-evolving process.

If anything, the language is livelier than ever. Technology has enabled it to transform at the fastest pace yet.

> The algospeak era gives us a new medium to retell very old stories. It’s incredible that we’re seeing time-honored patterns—like the continued ways to euphemize death—play out in a novel context. It’s still the same process, just happening in a new setting and happening much faster than ever before. While it might have historically taken words like “decease” hundreds of years to catch on, “unalive” did the same thing in just a decade, thanks to the new medium of TikTok and its subsequent copycats, like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.
