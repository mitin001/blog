# Postscript: A Brief History of Why the U.S. Consumer Thinks the Way They Do

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered four questions about the economy, the recent authoritarian takeover of it, and what made people allow it to happen.

## Will the world economy recover from Trump's tariffs?

Yes, the economy trends in the upward direction. Its contractions, whether from policies of one bad president or a pandemic, are momentary and fleeting. Things will improve.

> Economics is the story of cycles. Things come, things go.

## Why did Americans elect Donald Trump?

Cynicism borne from income inequality.

> You can scoff at linking the rise of Trump to income inequality alone. And you should. These things are always layers of complexity deep. But it’s a key part of what drives people to think, “I don’t live in the world I expected. That pisses me off. So screw this. And screw you! I’m going to fight for something totally different, because this—whatever it is—isn’t working.” Take that mentality and raise it to the power of Facebook, Instagram, and cable news—where people are more keenly aware of how other people live than ever before. It’s gasoline on a flame. Benedict Evans says, “The more the Internet exposes people to new points of view, the angrier people get that different views exist.” That’s a big shift from the post-war economy where the range of economic opinions were smaller, both because the actual range of outcomes was lower and because it wasn’t as easy to see and learn what other people thought and how they lived.

It is not the idiocy of the citizens that allows authoritarians to take over their government. It is the citizens' cynicism. It's when the people are hurting so much they no longer trust anyone that an authoritarian can rise up and tell them that their instincts to distrust the institutions are right and that the strongman alone can tell them what to believe.

## How bad is the income inequality in America?

So bad that almost all the spoils from the growth of the economy end up in the pockets of the top 1 percent, according to The Atlantic.

> Between 1993 and 2012, the top 1 percent saw their incomes grow 86.1 percent, while the bottom 99 percent saw just 6.6 percent growth.

## Why do people working middle-class jobs almost never save enough money to retire early and live off the interest from their investments? 

Because they try to keep up with the Joneses, and the Joneses are the extremely wealthy people our culture seems to idolize.

> Joe, an investment banker making $900,000 a year, buys a 4,000 square foot house with two Mercedes and sends three of his kids to Pepperdine. He can afford it. Peter, a bank branch manager making $80,000 a year, sees Joe and feels a subconscious sense of entitlement to live a similar lifestyle, because Peter’s parents believed—and instilled in him—that Americans’ lifestyles weren’t that different even if they had different jobs. His parents were right during their era, because incomes fell into a tight distribution. But that was then. Peter lives in a different world. But his expectations haven’t changed much from his parents’, even if the facts have. So what does Peter do? He takes out a huge mortgage. He has $45,000 of credit card debt. He leases two cars. His kids will graduate with heavy student loans. He can’t afford the stuff Joe can, but he’s pushed to stretch for the same lifestyle. It is a big stretch. This would have seemed preposterous to someone in the 1930s. But we’ve spent 75 years since the end of the war fostering a cultural acceptance of household debt.

In the post-WWII America, there was not much income inequality and low-interest debt was an instrument the government used to prop up the families of the returning soldiers.

> The defining characteristic of economics in the 1950s is that the country got rich by making the poor less poor.

However, in today's economy, debt is no longer low-cost and income inequality is worse than ever, and yet the attitudes of the citizens haven't changed, and neither has human nature. Everyone wants nice things, just as nice as those in the top 1 percent have.

> Sharp inequality became a force over the last 35 years, and it happened during a period where, culturally, Americans held onto two ideas rooted in the post-WW2 economy: That you should live a lifestyle similar to most other Americans, and that taking on debt to finance that lifestyle is acceptable.
