This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered a question about investing.

## What is a good investment strategy? 

Make sure your investment portfolio captures the stocks that are going to be successful. Because you don't know which ones will be successful, simply invest far and wide. This will increase the likelihood your investment portfolio captures the successful ones. When a stock is successful, it is spectacularly successful—so much so that it pays for the rest of your investment portfolio and more. You don't need to put any more effort into investing.

> There is little correlation between investment effort and investment results. The reason is because the world is driven by tails—a few variables account for the majority of returns. No matter how hard you try at investing you won’t do well if you miss the two or three things that move the needle in your strategy. The reverse is true. Simple investment strategies can work great as long as they capture the few things that are important to that strategy’s success. My investing strategy doesn’t rely on picking the right sector, or timing the next recession. It relies on a high savings rate, patience, and optimism that the global economy will create value over the next several decades.

The author of _The Psychology of Money_ lives modestly and invests everything into diversified index funds.

> We’ll have a high chance of meeting all of our family’s financial goals if we consistently invest money into a low-cost index fund for decades on end, leaving the money alone to compound. A lot of this view comes from our lifestyle of frugal spending. If you can meet all your goals without having to take the added risk that comes from trying to outperform the market, then what’s the point of even trying? I can afford to not be the greatest investor in the world, but I can’t afford to be a bad one.

How diverse should the index funds be? They should capture international stocks. How much money should be invested? Everything left over after the basics are met.

> We invest money from every paycheck into these index funds—a combination of U.S. and international stocks. There’s no set goal—it’s just whatever is leftover after we spend. We max out retirement accounts in the same funds, and contribute to our kids’ 529 college savings plans.
