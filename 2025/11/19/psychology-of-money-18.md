# 18. When You’ll Believe Anything

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered four questions about confidence and the conflict of truth against falsehood.

## What causes economic downturns? 

Loss of confidence in economic institutions.

> The stories we told ourselves about the economy. In 2007, we told a story about the stability of housing prices, the prudence of bankers, and the ability of financial markets to accurately price risk. In 2009 we stopped believing that story. That’s the only thing that changed. But it made all the difference in the world. Once the narrative that home prices will keep rising broke, mortgage defaults rose, then banks lost money, then they reduced lending to other businesses, which led to layoffs, which led to less spending, which led to more layoffs, and on and on. Other than clinging to a new narrative, we had an identical—if not greater—capacity for wealth and growth in 2009 as we did in 2007. Yet the economy suffered its worst hit in 80 years.

The economy rebounds only when the confidence in it is regained. The reason we didn't have a recession post-COVID was because COVID was immediately followed by a new technology the world chose to believe in: AI. We didn't have an overhyped technology like that to pull us out of the housing crisis of 2008, so the confidence in the economy was regained at a much slower pace, and the recession dragged on. It should be noted, however, that not everything else in life lends itself to self-fulfilling prophecies as efficiently as the economy. Manifesting an end to wars, for example, is choosing to believe in appealing fictions.

> The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true. What was the happiest day of your life? The documentary How to Live Forever asks that innocent question to a centenarian who offered an amazing response. “Armistice Day,” she said, referring to the 1918 agreement that ended World War I. “Why?” the producer asks. “Because we knew there would be no more wars ever again,” she says. World War II began 21 years later, killing 75 million people. There are many things in life that we think are true because we desperately want them to be true.

## Should you believe financial forecasts? 

No, just assume that the markets will continue to give you returns year over year.

> If you just assume that the market goes up every year by its historic average, your accuracy is better than if you follow the average annual forecasts of the top 20 market strategists from large Wall Street banks.

Financial forecasts are often wrong. Financial quakery is everywhere. This is because the field of investing is a mad gold rush. People lose the capacity to think rationally when emotions are involved. Unthinking people reinforce financial quacks.

> Investing is one of the only fields that offers daily opportunities for extreme rewards. People believe in financial quackery in a way they never would for, say, weather quackery because the rewards for correctly predicting what the stock market will do next week are in a different universe than the rewards for predicting whether it will be sunny or rainy next week.

## Authoritarian takeovers of democracy begin with people themselves putting strongmen in charge. Why do people fall for them? 

Philip Tetlock explains that this is because we have a strong psychological need to feel safe, and we are inclined to listen to anyone who promises us safety.

> We need to believe we live in a predictable, controllable world, so we turn to authoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy that need.

This is also why we continue to empower people who are often wrong but never in doubt, like financial forecasters.

## Why are people so often confidently wrong?

Because when we don't know the answer (or don't know that we don't know the answer), we rely on heuristics, such as confirmation bias or illusory truth. These are a reflection of our life experience, which is only a tiny fraction of what the world actually is.

> Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps.

B. H. Liddell Hart explains that cognitive biases stemming from this have a significant effect on professional historians.

> History cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so overwhelming that selection is inevitable. Where there is selection there is art. Those who read history tend to look for what proves them right and confirms their personal opinions. They defend loyalties. They read with a purpose to affirm or to attack. They resist inconvenient truth since everyone wants to be on the side of the angels. Just as we start wars to end all wars.

History is told by victors. Being on the right side of history isn't necessarily about being virtuous. It's about following those who will be in charge of writing or rewriting history.
