# 19. All Together Now

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered a question about investing money and a question about saving money.

## How to be a good investor? 

The best thing you can add an investor is to start early.

> If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon. Time is the most powerful force in investing. It makes little things grow big and big mistakes fade away.

Then, diversify. Investing works like making movies. Expect that most of your investments will be duds, but if you have enough of them, you'll increase the likelihood of stumbling into one or two that are so spectacular they'll pay for the rest of them and more.

> You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things account for the majority of outcomes.

When assessing whether someone has done well or poorly, don't look at the tail ends of their investments. Look at the whole portfolio. If you do that, you'll notice that no one is that brilliant or idiotic. What sets winners apart from losers is mainly time: how much they've been in the game.

> Always measure how you’ve done by looking at your full portfolio, rather than individual investments. It is fine to have a large chunk of poor investments and a few outstanding ones. That’s usually the best-case scenario. Judging how you’ve done by focusing on individual investments makes winners look more brilliant than they were, and losers appear more regrettable than they should.

If you're doing poorly, simply give it time. The market will rebound eventually. Your investments will have returns. If you can't wait because you've completely run out of money, then make sure that next time you include in your financial plan a larger room for error.

> A gap between what could happen in the future and what you need to happen in the future in order to do well is what gives you endurance, and endurance is what makes compounding magic over time. Room for error often looks like a conservative hedge, but if it keeps you in the game it can pay for itself many times over.

## When should you buy yourself nice things? 

Only if they're the least expensive thing to give you what you need. If what you need is admiration of other people, you don't need things to get it.

> Be nicer and less flashy. No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are. You might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch. But what you probably want is respect and admiration. And you’re more likely to gain those things through kindness and humility than horsepower and chrome.

Also, don't buy something just because others are buying it. You don't know what goals they're trying to accomplish by buying those things. Your goals may be completely different from theirs, and their things won't necessarily help you reach them. What you do need is more money, and spending it on nice things definitely won't help that.

> Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income.
