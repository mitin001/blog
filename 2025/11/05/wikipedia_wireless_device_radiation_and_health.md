# [Wireless device radiation and health](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wireless_device_radiation_and_health)

A [New York Times article](../../../2025/11/03/nytimes-cellphone-radiation-cancer.md) reported on an alarming study: experimenters were able to grow malignant tumors in rats using a device similar to a 1990s cell phone. So, nonionizing radiation can cause cancer after all? This Wikipedia article answered a question about lawsuits that pertain to this topic.

## What happens when a cancer patient sues a cell phone manufacturer to try to get it to cover the costs of treatment?

The case gets dismissed due to a lack of reliable evidence, as can be attested by several manufacturers that found themselves in the role of defendants in such cases.

> In the US, personal injury lawsuits have been filed by individuals against manufacturers (including Motorola, NEC, Siemens, and Nokia) on the basis of allegations of causation of brain cancer and death.

There is no scientific consensus on a link between cell phones and cancer. Until it is reached, the claims to the contrary cannot be evaluated.

> In a 2002 case against Motorola, the plaintiffs alleged that the use of wireless handheld telephones could cause brain cancer and that the use of Motorola phones caused one plaintiff's cancer. The judge ruled that no sufficiently reliable and relevant scientific evidence in support of either general or specific causation was proffered by the plaintiffs, accepted a motion to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs' experts, and denied a motion to exclude the testimony of the defendants' experts.

If a conspiracy theory blog leads a plaintiff to believe that his cancer was caused by his cell phone, this plaintiff will lose the case because this evidence won't convince anyone in a court of law.

> No sufficiently reliable and relevant scientific evidence in support of either general or specific causation has been proffered by the plaintiffs.
