# 3. Never Enough

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered three questions about financial happiness.

## What is the secret to happiness? 

Satiety.

> At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, “Yes, but I have something he will never have … enough.”

Once you make a decent living, focus on non-financial aspects to happiness. If you get caught up in trying to shake more and more money out of the markets, you may soon find yourself breaking laws. Bernie Madoff was very successful, but he just couldn't get enough, and so he started breaking laws.

> The market-making arm of Madoff’s business made between $25 million and $50 million per year. Bernie Madoff’s legitimate, non-fraudulent business was by any measure a huge success. It made him hugely—and legitimately—wealthy. And yet, the fraud.

Greed got him right up to the line separating sound investment and fraud, and then it got him over this line. And he's not alone. The world of finance is chock-full of white-collar criminals. And not a single one of them had to commit his crimes to survive.

> They already had everything: unimaginable wealth, prestige, power, freedom. And they threw it all away because they wanted more. They had no sense of enough.

The reason for white-collar crime is simple. It is that awful feeling of having an inch one cannot scratch.

> The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.

So, remember that satiety is the secret to happiness. Don't try to be the winner of capitalism. It's an inhumanly long road, and if you get there, it's a desolate, sad place to be. Look at the dysfunctional lives of this generation of billionaires.

> The ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it’s a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with—to accept that you might have enough, even if it’s less than those around you.

If your goal is to earn today more than you earned yesterday, and you're already making more money than most people, stop. Look for happiness elsewhere.

> If expectations rise with results there is no logic in striving for more because you’ll feel the same after putting in extra effort. It gets dangerous when the taste of having more—more money, more power, more prestige—increases ambition faster than satisfaction. In that case one step forward pushes the goalpost two steps ahead. You feel as if you’re falling behind, and the only way to catch up is to take greater and greater amounts of risk.

There is more to life than money.

> Life isn’t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations.

A high-school jock with a B+ average will still get an excellent education, and he won't have to sacrifice his social development or love for sports. He will have a much richer life than a straight-A nerd. So it is with finance. Make just enough to lead a plentiful life, and then focus on your family and hobbies. You are human; winning a game of numbers won't make you happy.

> The only way to win in a Las Vegas casino is to exit as soon as you enter. That’s exactly how the game of trying to keep up with other people’s wealth works, too.

## Why do people commit fraud? 

Desperation borne out of poverty. Or greed. Bernie Madoff made millions before he realized that his life was empty and needed to be filled with crime.

> Why someone worth hundreds of millions of dollars would be so desperate for more money that they risked everything in pursuit of even more? Crime committed by those living on the edge of survival is one thing. A Nigerian scam artist once told The New York Times that he felt guilty for hurting others, but “poverty will not make you feel the pain.”

## If you came into a large sum of money, what do you do with it? 

Don't spend it. Put it in a high-yield savings account and live off the interest it earns. In capitalism, you get paid for just having a lot of money and not spending it. If you put money in a high-yield savings account, you will be paid just for having it. If you're merely holding on to a lot of money, say $100 million, the bank will pay you more than most jobs would, just for entrusting it with the money.

> A five percent annual return on that much money generates almost $600 an hour, 24 hours a day.

If you're merely standing next to a large pile of cash, you will be able to forever fill your pockets with cash, and the pile will never get smaller, thanks the magic of interest.
