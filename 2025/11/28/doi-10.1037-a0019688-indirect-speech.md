# [Rationales for indirect speech: The theory of the strategic speaker](https://doi.org/10.1037/A0019688)

This scholarly paper was referenced by [a scholarly article on insinuated speech](../../../2025/11/24/philpapers-camicg-insinuation.md). It answered three questions about social norms and the human behavior.

## If efficient exchange of information is the goal of communication, then why do people often deliberately speak in terms that have multiple meanings, thereby increasing the likelihood the speaker will select the unintended meaning to understand the message?

Because the information we exchange in communication lies not only in the content of the message but also the way it's communicated. According to the joint action theory of language (that language can only be understood when both speaker and hearer's participation in its use is examined), indirect speech is a way to establish equity.

> The joint striving for equity. If costs and benefits are not balanced for a speaker or hearer, it threatens their face, leads to distress, and sets up a shared goal of redressing the imbalance through compensating action or speech or a reinterpretation of the goods at stake.

When the speaker predicts that communicated information will cause negative emotions in the hearer, they soften the blow by making the message more cryptic, thereby redirecting the hearer's mind away from emotional arousal to decrypting the message. When the speaker predicts that their request for the hearer might be denied, they choose to voice it in such a way that it could be taken to have multiple meanings, thereby saving the hearer from the pain of having to directly reject the request, and instead reject the wrong request, which softens the blow from the speaker. For this reason, one almost never propositions another person with direct speech. Instead, we come up with euphemisms.

> Would you like to come up and see my etchings?

When the sexual advance such as this is rejected, the speaker will be able to console himself that it wasn't necessarily a rejection of him but that the hearer misunderstood what he intended. At this point, the speaker will be wise to drop the subject to save himself from the pain of a direct rejection. When an indirect sexual advance is accepted, the hearer's response will either be also indirect or with an added layer of politeness as recompense.

> Alan offers Barbara some Manzanilla sherry, and she accepts. When Alan proposes the offer, he puts his face at risk. What if she takes the sherry without adequate recompense? And when Barbara takes up his proposal, she puts her own face at risk. What if she cannot repay him for the favor?

If the speaker takes an action that is of benefit to you, you can take a reciprocal action that is of benefit to them. However, if the cost of the reciprocal action is too high for you, you can instead choose to reward the speaker with your politeness or a riddle (indirect speech).

> Barbara might save face by saying _Yes please_ (deferring to his autonomy) or _That’d be lovely_ (augmenting his self-worth). In politeness theory, these would be classified as examples of negative politeness and on-record indirect speech, respectively.

Just as there are on-record indirect speech and negative politeness, there are also off-record indirect speech and positive politeness. Off-record indirect speech would be to inject a euphemism into your response, indicating your willingness to reciprocate the action. Positive politeness would be just to say _thank you_.

> Compliments and terms of endearment and familiarity.

Saying _thank you, dear_ is even more polite although one must choose the term of endearment that's appropriate to the speaker given their relationship to the hearer. However, the hearer must not be too polite: the more polite they are, the more likely the speaker is to assume they're trying to take more than they're willing to give.

> Presumption of friendliness and shared goals inherent in positive politeness strikes participants as manipulative or presumptuous.

The more a conversation steers into seduction or propositioning, the further it strays from the cooperative principle of communication.

> A speaker and hearer cooperate to move a conversation forward, the hearer filling in whatever propositions are necessary to preserve the assumption that the speaker is trying to be informative, truthful, clear, and relevant.

Clearly, this is not how we communicate when there's any conflict of equity involved.

> Speakers veil their utterances.

Indirect speech, the mechanism by which we resolve conflicts of equity, is wholly incompatible with the cooperative principle of communication.

> Indirect speech, by definition, flouts the cooperative principle’s maxims to be clear, concise, truthful, and relevant.

Indirect speech allows speakers to exploit not only emotional loopholes but also legal ones. 

Screenshot

> Indirect propositions can allow for plausible deniability: A hearer favorably disposed to the request can accept it, whereas an uncooperative hearer cannot react antagonistically to it.

Insinuation creates a gray area of accountability for one's words. In such a gray area an inappropriate request can be made with impunity.

> Antagonistic hearers required more directness than cooperative hearers before acting on their interpretations.

People give insinuations the benefit of the doubt even when they are fully aware of the intended meaning behind them.

> The difference in initial clarity between a barefaced request and a thinly veiled innuendo might be small, but the gap between them might lead the hearer to decide that a direct request is the only logical place to draw a threshold for declaring a violation of the prevailing relational model.

Offering a bribe indirectly allows one to probe whether an officer will take it without facing the criminal consequences of offering one directly. With insinuation, one can always fall back on plausible deniability.

> With indirect speech, deniability is plausible to a virtual audience, even if it is plausible to neither the speaker nor the hearer.

Even if an honest officer sees through the insinuation, the judge might not.

> An honest officer, hearing the same innuendo, could not make a bribery charge stick in court by the high standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Then the indirect speech may allow the driver to combine the large benefit of bribing a dishonest officer with the relatively small cost of submitting to an honest one.

One can even split the indirect offer of a bribe into a sequence of probing questions, each steering slightly toward the bribery offer as the officer displays further hints of dishonesty. 

> A discourse of escalating propositions along the directness continuum which probe the hearer’s decision function in smaller increments.

Positivity turns into politeness, which turns into sycophancy, which turns into an insinuated obscene proposition.

> What a beautiful morning. I’m very sorry for speeding. I know I’ll have to pay for my mistake. I admire officers doing their duty. Can I make a contribution to the policeman’s benevolent association? Is there some way we could avoid the paperwork and settle it here?

Indirect speech allows one to violate social norms but then fall back on plausible deniability if called out.

> A speaker resorts to indirect speech when the relational model assumed by the speech act clashes with the model that currently holds between the speaker and hearer, avoiding the risk of awkwardness or shame in the same way that a briber avoids the risk of an arrest.

## Why is prostitution stigmatized by taboo?

For the same reason bribery is taboo: it's a violation of relational models of society.

> A person proposes to allot resources that are normally governed by communal sharing or authority ranking according to the rules of equality matching or market pricing instead. Examples include prostitution; extortion;
the solicitation of a quid pro quo sexual favor; the sale of votes, organs, or adoption rights; and buying one’s way out of jury duty or military service.

The stigma around prostitution is a consequence of the same socially-accepted system that makes it awkward to engage in market pricing between family and close friends.

> A husband can pick an hors d’oeuvre from his wife’s plate or vice-versa (communal sharing), but an employee cannot snatch an hors d’oeuvre from the plate of his supervisor (violation of authority ranking). Similarly, the sale of a car or house can feel perfectly comfortable between strangers or acquaintances (equality matching or market pricing), but it becomes awkward if conducted between close friends (a violation of communal sharing).

Members of society care so much about such norms not getting violated because they concern basic human needs and the needs of society, and if the system that distributes them is challenged, then it'll be made harder for them to know how to get those needs met.

> People care intensely about the prescriptions of relational models because these models are the means by which humans agree on how to distribute the resources (material, emotional, and sexual) needed by all members of their communities for survival and reproduction.

Anything that stands in the way of meeting basic needs is a top-priority obstacle, that is, overcoming such an obstacle becomes our first priority. Our ire goes there first. Prostitution challenges the system by which we get our sexual needs met, and so we decry it simply out of the fear that in the new system (one that could accommodate prostitution), we would no longer be able to get our sexual needs met. It's the fear of the unknown.

## Why do people sometimes insert familiar terms (like _honey_ or _dude_) to address strangers?

To assert dominance.

> Terms of solidarity like _chum_, _amigo_, and _buddy_ are often used aggressively, as in _Listen to me, pal!_ and _All right, mate, you want it, you can come and get it!_ Presumably this is because a presumption of intimacy when none exists is seen as a perquisite of a dominant individual.
