This episode of [Pivot](../../../2025/10/14/pivot.md) answered a question about happiness.

## What is the secret to happiness? 

Pursue everything in life that interests you, not just money.

> You don't own money, you rent it.

No one said on their deathbed that they wished to have more money. No matter how much of it you've made, you have to give it up. So, focus on experiences. Don't leave the world regretting you haven't traveled enough or seen your loved ones enough because you've been busy making money.
