# 13. Room for Error

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered two questions about planning.

## When is taking a risk worth it? 

When the risk isn't great enough as to wipe you out.

> We systematically underestimate risk. Housing prices fell 30% last decade. A few companies defaulted on their debt. That’s capitalism. It happens. But those with high leverage had a double wipeout: Not only were they left broke, but being wiped out erased every opportunity to get back in the game at the very moment opportunity was ripe. A homeowner wiped out in 2009 had no chance of taking advantage of cheap mortgage rates in 2010. Lehman Brothers had no chance of investing in cheap debt in 2009. They were done.

To find out if you can tolerate a risk, know what room for error means for you. This includes volatility. This also includes whether you can actually follow through with the plan even in the face of risk and the negative emotions it brings.

> Can you survive your assets declining by 30%? On a spreadsheet, maybe yes—in terms of actually paying your bills and staying cash-flow positive. But what about mentally? It is easy to underestimate what a 30% decline does to your psyche. Your confidence may become shot at the very moment opportunity is at its highest. You—or your spouse—may decide it’s time for a new plan, or new career. I know several investors who quit after losses because they were exhausted. Physically exhausted. Spreadsheets are good at telling you when the numbers do or don’t add up. They’re not good at modeling how you’ll feel when you tuck your kids in at night wondering if the investment decisions you’ve made were a mistake that will hurt their future. Having a gap between what you can technically endure versus what’s emotionally possible is an overlooked version of room for error.

To get through the hardship brought by enduring bad luck, keep reminding yourself that you're still well within the margin of error and that risk is a price you pay for great returns. Once it's paid up, the returns will follow. The market is not a casino: a sound investment strategy will always net you a profit if you stick to it long enough.

> Room for error lets you endure a range of potential outcomes, and endurance lets you stick around long enough to let the odds of benefiting from a low-probability outcome fall in your favor. The biggest gains occur infrequently, either because they don’t happen often or because they take time to compound. So the person with enough room for error in part of their strategy (cash) to let them endure hardship in another (stocks) has an edge over the person who gets wiped out, game over, insert more tokens, when they’re wrong.

## How to formulate an effective plan?

Contingency planning is effective planning.

> The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan.

For every component in your plan, have a plan of action in case the component breaks.

> A good rule of thumb for a lot of things in life is that everything that can break will eventually break. So if many things rely on one thing working, and that thing breaks, you are counting the days to catastrophe. That’s a single point of failure.

Learn from other carefully planned systems: those that don't have the single-point-of-failure problem (e.g., airplanes, bridges, savings accounts).

> Most critical systems on airplanes have backups, and the backups often have backups. Modern jets have four redundant electrical systems. You can fly with one engine and technically land with none, as every jet must be capable of stopping on a runway with its brakes alone, without thrust reverse from its engines. Suspension bridges can similarly lose many of their cables without falling. The biggest single point of failure with money is a sole reliance on a paycheck to fund short-term spending needs, with no savings to create a gap between what you think your expenses are and what they might be in the future.

Nothing in your plan should be exact. Everything must be a range of possibilities.

> Pursuing things where a range of potential outcomes are acceptable is the smart way to proceed.
