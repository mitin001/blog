# [Pivot](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/174725): [11/4/2025](https://writecomments.com/transcripts/?md5=70b3eca71a494960817a563b0fd50651)

This episode of [Pivot](../../../2025/10/14/pivot.md) answered a question about famous bullshitters and a question about airplane safety.

## Why is Elon Musk promising us flying cars?

Yet another distraction.

> Trump will say and do anything to create a distraction from Epstein. Musk will say and promise anything to distract from the fact this is a fucking car company that should be worth 90% less than what it's worth right now.

Musk and Trump are professional bullshitters. World-class bullshitters. They are among the richest and most powerful people in the world despite their utter incompetence and blatant disregard for the law.

## How dangerous is it to fly in an airplane? 

Planes are far safer than cars.

> The drive to the airport was about 30 times more dangerous than actually the plane ride.
