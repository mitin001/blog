# 4. Confounding Compounding

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered two questions about compounding: one about ice and the other—about money.

## What causes an ice age? 

When one of the Earth's hemispheres tilts away from the sun, that region doesn't get enough solar radiation to heat up the surface and so it grows a continental ice sheet.

> In the early 1900s a Serbian scientist named Milutin Milanković studied the Earth’s position relative to other planets and came up with the theory of ice ages that we now know is accurate: The gravitational pull of the sun and moon gently affect the Earth’s motion and tilt toward the sun. During parts of this cycle—which can last tens of thousands of years—each of the Earth’s hemispheres gets a little more, or a little less, solar radiation than they’re used to.

Of course, the amount of solar radiation varies by season as the Earth orbits around the sun, and too little in the winter gets balanced out by the excess in the summer. However, if the hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, such an orbital excess of solar radiation falls mostly on the other hemisphere, and the summer ends up not being warm enough to melt all the snow. Once the next winter comes, there's already leftover snow from the previous winter, and so the continental snowpack only snowballs from there.

> Milanković’s theory initially assumed that a tilt of the Earth’s hemispheres caused ravenous winters cold enough to turn the planet into ice. But a Russian meteorologist named Wladimir Köppen dug deeper into Milanković’s work and discovered a fascinating nuance. Moderately cool summers, not cold winters, were the icy culprit. It begins when a summer never gets warm enough to melt the previous winter’s snow. The leftover ice base makes it easier for snow to accumulate the following winter, which increases the odds of snow sticking around in the following summer, which attracts even more accumulation the following winter. Perpetual snow reflects more of the sun’s rays, which exacerbates cooling, which brings more snowfall, and on and on. Within a few hundred years a seasonal snowpack grows into a continental ice sheet.

An ice age happens when incremental changes in climate conditions stumble into a positive feedback loop.

> The amazing thing here is how big something can grow from a relatively small change in conditions. You start with a thin layer of snow left over from a cool summer that no one would think anything of and then, in a geological blink of an eye, the entire Earth is covered in miles-thick ice. As glaciologist Gwen Schultz put it: “It is not necessarily the amount of snow that causes ice sheets but the fact that snow, however little, lasts.”

## How is wealth created?

From compounding of investment. Just as an ice age results from a positive feedback loop of incremental changes in climate, wealth results in a positive feedback loop of incremental investment and interest calculated on top of previously leftover interest, i.e., compounding.

> You don’t need tremendous force to create tremendous results. If something compounds—if a little growth serves as the fuel for future growth—a small starting base can lead to results so extraordinary they seem to defy logic.

Warren Buffet is the richest person in investing, but not the smartest, at least not in terms of his day-to-day investment decisions. The reason for his unimaginable wealth is that he started investing early—before he even hit puberty. His money has had many decades to compound. Due to the exponential nature of compounding, he's made most of his money in the recent years, past his retirement age.

> Warren Buffett’s net worth is $84.5 billion. Of that, $84.2 billion was accumulated after his 50th birthday. $81.5 billion came after he qualified for Social Security, in his mid-60s. Warren Buffett is a phenomenal investor. But you miss a key point if you attach all of his success to investing acumen. The real key to his success is that he’s been a phenomenal investor for three quarters of a century. Had he started investing in his 30s and retired in his 60s, few people would have ever heard of him. Consider a little thought experiment. Buffett began serious investing when he was 10 years old. By the time he was 30 he had a net worth of $1 million, or $9.3 million adjusted for inflation. What if he was a more normal person, spending his teens and 20s exploring the world and finding his passion, and by age 30 his net worth was, say, $25,000? And let’s say he still went on to earn the extraordinary annual investment returns he’s been able to generate (22% annually), but quit investing and retired at age 60 to play golf and spend time with his grandkids. What would a rough estimate of his net worth be today? Not $84.5 billion. $11.9 million. 99.9% less than his actual net worth. Effectively all of Warren Buffett’s financial success can be tied to the financial base he built in his pubescent years and the longevity he maintained in his geriatric years. His skill is investing, but his secret is time. That’s how compounding works.
