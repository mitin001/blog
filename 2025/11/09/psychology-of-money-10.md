# 10. Save Money

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered a question about the accumulation of global wealth.

## What drives the economy? 

Innovation, not extraction. We generate wealth by finding more efficient ways of making use of the resources that we have, not extracting more resources.

> The average miles per gallon of all vehicles on the road has doubled since 1975. A 1989 Ford Taurus (sedan) averaged 18.0 MPG. A 2019 Chevy Suburban (absurdly large SUV) averages 18.1 MPG. The world grew its “energy wealth” not by increasing the energy it had, but by decreasing the energy it needed. U.S. oil and gas production has increased 65% since 1975, while conservation and efficiency has more than doubled what we can do with that energy.
