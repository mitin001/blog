# 9. Wealth is What You Don’t See

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered a question about exterior signs of wealth and how misleading they might be.

## What does it mean to be a millionaire? 

Not spending it all. If you spend it all, you will no longer be a millionaire.

> When most people say they want to be a millionaire, what they might actually mean is “I’d like to spend a million dollars.” And that is literally the opposite of being a millionaire.

Instead, invest your million and live off the modest interest it generates you. Being a millionaire doesn't mean having a million things.

> Singer Rihanna nearly went bankrupt after overspending and sued her financial advisor. The advisor responded: “Was it really necessary to tell her that if you spend money on things, you will end up with the things and not the money?”

Being a millionaire means living modestly but never having to worry about money.

> The world is filled with people who look modest but are actually wealthy and people who look rich who live at the razor’s edge of insolvency. Keep this in mind when quickly judging others’ success and setting your own goals.

A millionaire only has to worry about money if he squanders it on things he doesn't need.

> Someone driving a $100,000 car might be wealthy. But the only data point you have about their wealth is that they have $100,000 less than they did before they bought the car (or $100,000 more in debt). That’s all you know about them.

When you see someone with nice things, don't assume he's a millionaire. When you see someone living modestly, he might secretly be a millionaire (think Ronald Read).

> Wealth is what you don’t see. Wealth is the nice cars not purchased. The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see.
