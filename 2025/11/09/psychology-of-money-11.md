This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered a question about the immune system.

## Should you treat a fever? 

Not if its under 104°F. It's part of the normal immune response to eliminate pathogens in the body. Let it run its course.

> A one-degree increase in body temperature has been shown to slow the replication rate of some viruses by a factor of 200.

Before penicillin, doctors were inducing fevers in patients to treat diseases like neurosyphilis. Unfortunately, their methods involved infecting patients with other pathogens, ones they hypothesized to be less dangerous than syphilis. Sometimes, they were right. Other times, they were wrong.

> In the early 1900s Wagner-Jauregg began injecting patients with low-end strains of typhoid, malaria, and smallpox to trigger fevers strong enough to kill off their syphilis. This was as dangerous as it sounds. Some of his patients died from the treatment. He eventually settled on a weak version of malaria, since it could be effectively countered with quinine after a few days of bone-rattling fevers. After some tragic trial and error his experiment worked. Wagner-Jauregg reported that 6 in 10 syphilis patients treated with “malariotherapy” recovered, compared to around 3 in 10 patients left alone. He won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1927. The organization today notes: “The main work that concerned Wagner-Jauregg throughout his working life was the endeavour to cure mental disease by inducing a fever.”
