This academic paper was referenced by [an academic paper on self-control](../../../2025/11/04/pmc4736542-self-control.md). It answered two questions about self-control.

## What is self-control? 

It's when you're choosing to further a long-term goal by sacrificing a short-term one.

> Self-control requires one to make decisions and to act in accordance with long-term rather than short-term outcomes.

## How to effectively exercise self-control? 

Reduce the cognitive load required to maintain it. For example, remove yourself from an environment where you'd have to constantly consciously override your addiction triggers.

> Exerting self-control requires one to inhibit consciously undesired automatic, routinized reactions. For example, a smoker who decides to quit must consciously fight the habitual urge to light up when among other smoking peers. When individuals monitor their actions consciously and prevent automatic behaviors from being executed, they are said to be exerting self-control. According to this model, any factor that impinges on one’s conscious resources would increase self-control failures.

Aid your self-control brain circuits by focusing on the goal of avoiding the long-term harm of the action you're trying to keep yourself from taking. Actively talk yourself out of taking the problematic action. The more brain systems you engage into self-control, the less likely it is to fail. Make your brain live in the future tense.

> Factors that draw attention to immediate, near-future outcomes are likely to undermine self-control efforts, whereas those that direct attention to more distant future outcomes are more likely to strengthen self-control efforts.

Make your brain analyze the temptation in a cold, neutral way.

> Factors that enhance the activation of the hot system (e.g., attention to the appetitive qualities of a stimulus) will hamper self-control, whereas those that promote the activation of the cool system over the hot system will enhance self-control (e.g., mental transformation of temptations into nonappetitive objects).

If you're tempted to eat a marshmallow, don't think about how yummy it looks. Rather, think about how it looks like a cloud. Think in descriptive terms. Do not let your emotional or visceral arousal take charge. Have your rational mind wrestle control away from them if you want to maintain self-control. If you're hungry, distract your mind with a puzzle. This also works for when you're sexually aroused (but need to save it for intercourse with your significant other that is to take place at a later time).

> Exerting self-control requires reducing the impact of visceral reactions on one’s preferences, decisions, and actions. Factors that increase the physiological arousal (e.g., states of deprivation) should negatively impact self-control.
