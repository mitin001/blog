This FAQ was referenced by [Wikipedia's article on the adverse effects of wireless device radiation on human health](../../../2025/11/05/wikipedia_wireless_device_radiation_and_health.md). It answered three questions about radiation and two questions about basic epidemiology.

## How can radiofrequency radiation kill cancer cells?

By heating them up.

> The radio waves are sent through needles inserted into tumor tissue and may kill cancer cells.

This is called radiofrequency ablation.

> A procedure that uses radio waves to heat and destroy abnormal cells. The radio waves travel through electrodes (small devices that carry electricity).

## When is radiation considered ionizing?

When it has very high energy, on the scale of the force keeping electrons attracted to protons. Ionizing radiation has enough energy to counteract the electrical force.

> Enough energy to remove an electron (negative particle) from an atom or molecule, causing it to become ionized.

High energy means high frequency. Radiofrequency radiation is low-frequency; it is not ionizing radiation.

## How do you know if you're absorbing too much radiofrequency radiation from a cell phone or WiFi-enabled device?

If the area of your body absorbing the radiation gets hot.

> The human body does absorb energy from devices that emit radiofrequency radiation. The only consistently recognized biological effect of radiofrequency radiation absorption in humans that the general public might encounter is heating to the area of the body where a cell phone is held (e.g., the ear and head). However, that heating is not sufficient to measurably increase core body temperature.

Radiofrequency radiation raises the temperature of the biological tissue that absorbs it. That's how microwaves heat up food. However, regulations don't allow manufacturer of consumer devices that can raise the temperature of biological tissue near it by more than 1°C.

## What does it mean for something to be statistically significant?

Statistical significance is a mechanism by which researchers essentially rule out the possibility that their findings arose from noise in the data. It is a measure of evidence against chance.

> A mathematical measure of difference between groups. The difference is said to be statistically significant if it is greater than what might be expected to happen by chance alone.

If we compared two groups and found a difference between them to be statistically significant, it means it is extremely unlikely that the difference could happen by chance.

## What is the difference between morbidity and mortality? 

Mortality rate refers to the percentage of people for which a disease is fatal. For example, when the mortality rate of a disease is 40%, then out of 10 people who develop the disease, we expect 4 to die from it. Morbidity refers to the percentage of people who develop a disease. For example, when a disease has 25% morbidity rate in a certain population, we expect 1 in 4 people in this population to develop the disease.
