# 12. Surprise!

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered three questions about history and its role in predicting the future.

## How did 9/11 lead to the student debt crisis?

The terrorist attack shook the country, including its economy. Many people ended up jobless and felt like they needed more school for better job prospects. Many had no money to pay for school (because they were jobless), and so now we're in the student debt crisis.

> 9/11 prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, which led to the financial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market, which led tens of millions to seek a college education, which led to $1.6 trillion in student loans with a 10.8% default rate. It’s not intuitive to link 19 hijackers to the current weight of student loans, but that’s what happens in a world driven by a few outlier tail events.

Who could've predicted that come the new millennium America would be under attack from Islamic terrorists? Who could've predicted that one of the downstream effects of this tragedy would be such a high demand for student loans?

> The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising. Not that we should use past surprises as a guide to future boundaries; that we should use past surprises as an admission that we have no idea what might happen next. The most important economic events of the future—things that will move the needle the most—are things that history gives us little to no guide about. They will be unprecedented events. Their unprecedented nature means we won’t be prepared for them, which is part of what makes them so impactful.

What ultimately changes the course of history? Outlier events at the tails of statistical distributions.

> The thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easy it is to underestimate how things compound.

## How to properly learn from history? 

If must learn from history, learn from recent history.

> Recent history is often the best guide to the future, because it’s more likely to include important conditions that are relevant to the future.

If you must learn from distant history, make sure your lessons are about unchanging things (like universal laws or the human nature).

> The further back in history you look, the more general your takeaways should be. General things like people’s relationship to greed and fear, how they behave under stress, and how they respond to incentives tend to be stable in time. The history of money is useful for that kind of stuff. But specific trends, specific trades, specific sectors, specific causal relationships about markets, and what people should do with their money are always an example of evolution in progress. Historians are not prophets.

Do not put too much stock in historical events when trying to predict the future. The history of the next century will look nothing like the history of the past century. If you try to use one to predict the other, you're trying to reconcile the irreconcilable.

> Things that have never happened before happen all the time. History is mostly the study of surprising events. But it is often used by investors and economists as an unassailable guide to the future.

## Is there a formula to investing? 

No, even the best book purporting to give investment advice is wrong. Benjamin Graham's investment advice was outdated as soon as it was published. This was not the fault of the author, except that he chose to study something that's impossible to predict.

> The Intelligent Investor is one of the greatest investing books of all time. But I don’t know a single investor who has done well implementing Graham’s published formulas.

There is no formula to investing, and yet, Graham kept trying to find one.

> In each revised edition of The Intelligent Investor, Graham discarded the formulas he presented in the previous edition and replaced them with new ones.
