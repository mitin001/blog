# [A new experiment in remote work](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5601059)

This episode of [Planet Money](../../../2025/10/23/planet-money.md) answered a question about the job market. 

## How to get a six-figure job as a programmer while incarcerated?

Start contributing to an open-source project like SQLite with a laptop that you have for vocational training. Be like Preston Thorpe.

> Because Preston had a laptop, you know, in his cell all day and all night that he could use for certain approved things, Preston started contributing to this big open-source coding project.

Through his contributions on GitHub, Preston showed to the world, including wealthy corporations, that he was so good that one such company couldn't not hire him. Now he's a gainfully employed prisoner. He makes six figures.

> Double what the corrections officers who guard him make.

This is not a common occurrence. Only 45 prisoners at the time of this reporting worked remote jobs for good pay. If you're in prison, use the time to achieve such mastery of your skill that you will be indispensable to a rich company regardless of your criminal record or state of incarceration.
