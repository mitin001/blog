# [Distinguishing Polemic From Commentary in Science](https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13013)

This article was referenced by [an article on 5G misinformation](../../../2025/10/31/nytimes-5g-phone-safety-health-russia.md). It answered a question about scrutinizing claims made by others.

## When someone is trying to convince you that since the characteristics of some disease are similar to those produced by exposure to something, the conclusion is that the exposure causes the disease, should you believe them?

No, scrutinize any claim that uses an analogy.

> Going out in the sun makes you hot; therefore, fever is caused by going out in the sun.

See if there is stronger evidence for or against the claim. See if there's correlation between the two variables or, better yet, if any experiments have been conducted to establish or refute a casual link between them.

> The strongest kind of scientific evidence for causality comes from experiment: manipulate one factor and observe its effect. For many environmental factors in the natural world, experiment is hard and evidence instead comes from observational studies: correlation between a potential risk factor and a given condition.

Know the difference between fact backed up by evidence and a polemic couched in jargon to obfuscate ignorance.

> Authors are entitled to express viewpoints in commentaries, but they should be informed and objective, rather than polemics based on cherry-picked information dressed up in impressive-sounding technical language.

The use of jargon can be a disguise, and we must learn to see through it.

> The authors are employing technical scientific terminology to obfuscate poor reasoning rather than illuminate valid arguments.
