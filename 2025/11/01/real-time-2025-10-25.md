This episode of [Real Time](../../../2025/10/16/real-time.md) answered a question about the difference between the Democrats and Republicans.

## Why should we prefer Democrats over Republicans?

Reason #123: at least Democrats don't put their crazies in office.

> Each side has its crazies. And I'll grant you, at least the right has found a place for theirs. Unfortunately, that place is elected government.
