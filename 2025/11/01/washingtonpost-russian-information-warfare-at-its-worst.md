This article was referenced by [Wikipedia's article about the firehouse of falsehood](../../../2025/10/24/wikipedia_firehose_of_falsehood.md). It answered a question about tensions between the Russians and the Baltic peoples.

## Are the Baltics inhospitable for the Russians due to hostilities directed at them from the natives?

It doesn't appear so. The Russian population in the Baltics is significant, and if there are any hostilities, they don't appear to be driving the Russians out. On the contrary, the Russian communities there are recognized by the government, which invests resources into ensuring that even their Russian citizens remain well-informed.

> Estonia has opened its own Russian-language TV channel, a modest attempt to counter the hitherto-near-unchallenged supremacy of Putinâ€™s broadcast empire.

The propaganda arm of the Russian government tries its hardest to penetrate the Baltics, and their main targets are the Russian populations there. This is the playbook they used in Ukraine prior to invading it.

> They used imaginary fascism to turn Ukraine from a friendly nation into their most serious enemy.
