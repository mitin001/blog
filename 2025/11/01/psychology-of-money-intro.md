# Introduction: The Greatest Show On Earth

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered two questions about the field of finance.

## How is it possible to become wealthy without training in financial literacy?

Because financial success relies on human psychology more than it does on any theoretical framework. Financial decisions are can be hijacked by emotion.

> Financial success is not a hard science. It’s a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know.

Becoming successful without any training in the field is only possible in the field of finance.

> In what other industry does someone with no college degree, no training, no background, no formal experience, and no connections massively outperform someone with the best education, the best training, and the best connections?

Science is unemotional, but finance is not.

> Engineers can determine the cause of a bridge collapse because there’s agreement that if a certain amount of force is applied to a certain area, that area will break. Physics isn’t controversial. It’s guided by laws. Finance is different. It’s guided by people’s behaviors. And how I behave might make sense to me but look crazy to you.

Even a low-paid worker can amass millions in wealth if he is unemotional with his finances. Case in point: Ronald Read.

> Read saved what little he could and invested it in blue chip stocks. Then he waited, for decades on end, as tiny savings compounded into more than $8 million. That’s it. From janitor to philanthropist.

## Is financial engineering a bullshit field? 

It appears so because knowledge in this field (or the illusion of it) seems to make no difference in determining one's success in it. Compare it with an obviously nonbullshit field. The sciences have advanced to an unprecedented degree as more science training became available. But the financial sector doesn't seem to benefit from training in finance. The success of any given investment is just as random as it's always been, even as many more people now have degrees in business and finance.

> Scientific discoveries have replaced doctors’ old ideas about how the human body works, and virtually everyone is healthier because of it. The money industry—investing, personal finance, business planning—is another story. Finance has scooped up the smartest minds coming from top universities over the last two decades. Financial Engineering was the most popular major in Princeton’s School of Engineering a decade ago. Is there any evidence it has made us better investors? I have seen none.

This is a shame because financial literacy is just as important as health literacy.

> Two topics impact everyone, whether you are interested in them or not: health and money.

While health literacy is easy to achieve (one needs only to look at the consensus among the people trained in the biological sciences), financial literacy is not (much consensus in this bullshit field is bullshit itself). No matter how mistaken the so-called experts are in the field of finance, they never seem to learn from their mistakes. Bullshit enterprises expose the flaw in human nature noticed long ago by Voltaire.

> History never repeats itself; man always does.
