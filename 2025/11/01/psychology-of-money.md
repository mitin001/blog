# [The Psychology of Money (Morgan Housel, 2020)](https://books.google.com/books?id=5HrrDwAAQBAJ)

As I got into the bestseller genre with books like [Freakonomics](../../../2025/10/07/freakonomics-2015-when-to-rob-a-bank.md) and [Let Them](../../../2025/10/14/let-them.md), book recommendation sites like Goodreads seem to have taken note and recommended I read another bestseller, The Psychology of Money.
