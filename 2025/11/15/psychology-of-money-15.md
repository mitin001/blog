# 15. Nothing’s Free

This chapter of [The Psychology of Money](../../../2025/11/01/psychology-of-money.md) answered two questions about investing.

## If you invest in the diversified portfolio and your assets decline by 20%, should you accept the loss, take out what remains, and invest it in something else? 

No, if your diversified portfolio has a history of consistent year-over-year returns, keep the money there. You've simply just experienced volatility. That's the price of investing. Ignore the negative feelings you may have about it and trust that the market will come back up.

> When the bill comes due it doesn’t feel like a fee for getting something good. It feels like a fine for doing something wrong. And while people are generally fine with paying fees, fines are supposed to be avoided. You’re supposed to make decisions that preempt and avoid fines. Traffic fines and IRS fines mean you did something wrong and deserve to be punished. The natural response for anyone who watches their wealth decline and views that drop as a fine is to avoid future fines. It sounds trivial, but thinking of market volatility as a fee rather than a fine is an important part of developing the kind of mindset that lets you stick around long enough for investing gains to work in your favor. Few investors have the disposition to say, “I’m actually fine if I lose 20% of my money.” This is doubly true for new investors who have never experienced a 20% decline.

If you look at any successful stock portfolio, it appears to be down most of the time, and yet it still manages to generate significant wealth for its long-term investments because, regardless of short-term volatility, it trends up long-term.

> Say you want to earn an 11% annual return over the next 30 years so you can retire in peace. Does this reward come free? Of course not. The world is never that nice. There’s a price tag, a bill that must be paid. In this case it’s a never-ending taunt from the market, which gives big returns and takes them away just as fast. Including dividends the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned about 11% per year from 1950 to 2019, which is great. But the price of success during this period was dreadfully high. The shaded lines in the chart show when it was at least 5% below its previous all-time high.

## Should you experiment with investment strategies to try to come up with one that pays off without volatility?

No, the best investment strategy is to invest in a diversified portfolio and let the market oscillate up and down, expecting modest annual returns on investment. There will be downward swings. You just need to learn to ignore them.

> Like everything else worthwhile, successful investing demands a price. But its currency is not dollars and cents. It’s volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret—all of which are easy to overlook until you’re dealing with them in real time. The inability to recognize that investing has a price can tempt us to try to get something for nothing. Which, like shoplifting, rarely ends well.

There is no free lunch.

> Everything has a price, and the key to a lot of things with money is just figuring out what that price is and being willing to pay it. The problem is that the price of a lot of things is not obvious until you’ve experienced them firsthand, when the bill is overdue.

Many before you have tried to cheat the market. If you're crazy, you could try to do the same.

> You can attempt the equivalent of grand-theft auto: Try to get the return while avoiding the volatility that comes along with it.

You could try to devise ways of investing that would avoid paying in volatility.

> Like a car thief—though well-meaning and law-abiding—they form tricks and strategies to get the return without paying the price. They trade in and out. They attempt to sell before the next recession and buy before the next boom.

The trouble is, it doesn't work most of the time. You have the same odds as a car thief getting away with his crime.

> Some car thieves will get away with it. Many more will be caught and punished. Same thing with investing.

If you play by the rules, you know there is a certain expected payoff. Just like if you pay for a car, you can expect to own it. However, if you go outside the rules of the market, you no longer have such guarantees. If you steal a car, it's uncertain and often unlikely that you will get to keep it. Similarly, if you cheat the market, its expected long-term gains no longer apply to you. You may win big or lose everything.

> By trying to avoid the price, investors end up paying double.
