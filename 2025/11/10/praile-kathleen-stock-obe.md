This post was referenced by [a scholarly article on trans philosophy](../../../2025/10/30/doi-10.1002-9781119635253.ch19-trans-philosophy.md). It answered a question about social media and a question about conspiracy theories.

## Why do people delete their social media posts?

Because they see no value in preserving a discussion once it's over. Some people use social media as a sliding window. If you go to their account, you only see their recent posts. Everything else has been deleted.

> Stock has set her tweets to automatically delete after a short time.

Social media is immediate. After a post lives for a few days, you will see a sharp drop in engagement. Why continue to have it on your profile if you've already gotten 99% of the engagement from it, especially when there are people who specifically dig through one's post history looking to dunk on them? People who delete their old posts may argue that they've an ever-evolving person, and only the recent snapshot of their thoughts truly represents them, and so no one should see their past thoughts.

## How to test whether something is a conspiracy theory or not? 

If it disregards the evidence to the contrary and doubles down on the disproven claim, then it is a conspiracy theory.

> With every conspiracy theory, all the evidence to the contrary becomes only evidence of how deep the conspiracy goes.

When a transphobe like Kathleen Stock is shown research indicating that conversation therapy is harmful or that trans people are at significantly more danger of violent crime, she simply dismisses those facts as myths the establishment doesn't allow scholars to debunk.

> To Stock, the fact that the research is not on her side is only evidence of a conspiracy, that "contrary research is discouraged," that the real evidence is being "politically suppressed."

To Stock, the countless accounts of real trans individuals, the subjects of her chosen field of study, or the researchers who take them seriously and evaluate their opinions critically are to be dismissed because her conspiracy theory is gospel and anyone who disagrees with it is a heretic.

> You can't dismiss so much mainstream academic research and expert consensus without the pseudo persecution, without a conspiracy theory about how the real evidence is being suppressed.

Such thinking becomes dangerous when it seeps into the justice system. Trans rights get denied simply on the basis of the existence of a group of conspiracy theorists who dislike trans people. 

> Stock's claims of persecution and suppression were cited in multiple U.S. Supreme Court briefs arguing that anti-trans workplace discrimination should be legal, in one specifically as evidence that the medical consensus about trans people's needs should not be trusted.
