# [When Science Is Lost in a Legal Maze](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/science/when-science-is-lost-in-a-legal-maze.html)

This article was referenced by [an article on 5G misinformation](../../../2025/10/31/nytimes-5g-phone-safety-health-russia.md). It answered a question about what happens when stupid cases don't get thrown out of court immediately.

## What happens when a person files a lawsuit alleging he was harmed but only citing conspiracy theorists as his evidence? 

Such a lawsuit is not necessarily thrown out, but the court will likely rule against such a plaintiff.

> Five years after the lawsuit was filed, the New Mexico Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s ruling that Arthur Firstenberg, an outspoken opponent of wireless technology, could not seek $1.43 million in damages from his neighbor, Raphaela Monribot, for damaging his health by using her iPhone and a Wi-Fi connection.

If the suit proceeds, it may turn into a years-long legal battle that will lead to the same result as if the case was thrown out.

> After two more years of claims and counterclaims, depositions and cross-examinations, days of hearings and pages of affidavits, the court was persuaded in its circuitous way of what science already knew: Mr. Firstenberg had no case.

The legal battle will be costly and a colossal waste of time and legal resources.

> The files for the case sat in boxes on a table. Piled together, the pages would reach more than six feet high.
Court costs, not counting lawyers’ fees, had come to almost $85,000, or more than $1,000 an inch. Because of what the court described as Mr. Firstenberg’s “inability to pay,” the bill went instead to Ms. Monribot’s landlord’s insurance company — as if someone had slipped on an icy sidewalk, or pretended to. Mr. Graeser and another lawyer, Joseph Romero, represented her pro bono, writing off an estimated $200,000 in legal fees.

And yet, the plaintiff may find a way to get out of the legal costs to keep the fight going.

> The next stop may be the New Mexico Supreme Court. After all, Mr. Graeser said, the plaintiff had “suffered no real disincentive to doing it again.”
