# Answered questions

This page categorizes the questions answered in this blog by [academic discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_academic_disciplines). Another possible way to do that would be to categorize them like Wikipedia articles, by [topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents): Culture, Geography, Health, History, Mathematics, Nature, People, Philosophy, Religion, Society, Technology. However, my approach to blogging is (loosely) academic rather than encyclopedic, so the former categorization will suffice.
